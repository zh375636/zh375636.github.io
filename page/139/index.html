<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Setting up a Google Cloud Platform Environment”. My name is Daniel Mease and I’ll be taking you through this course. I am a Google Cloud Platform instructor at Cloud Academy with over 20 years of software and web development experience.</p>
<p>In this course, I am going to show you how to organize your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">GCP</a> account using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">projects</a> and prepare it for development.</p>
<p>This course is intended for Google Cloud Platform Administrators or people who want to get GCP certified (eg: Associate Cloud Engineer).</p>
<p>After completing this course, you will be able to create and manage cloud projects, create and add users to projects, assign permissions to users, enable APIs for a project, and set up budgets and monitor spending.</p>
<p>The following prerequisites will be helpful for this course. Access to a GCP admin account is not strictly required, but it will be useful if you want to practice the tasks I will be demonstrating. If you didn’t already know, you can sign up for a free trial.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses is valuable to both us as trainers and our future students. If you have any criticisms or suggestions for improvement, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share those with us.</p>
<p>Please note, when this video was recorded, all course information was accurate. Google is constantly updating its products and services as part of its ongoing drive to innovate. As a result, over time, minor discrepancies may appear in the course content. Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content up to date in order to provide the best training available. </p>
<p>So, if you notice any information that is outdated, please contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. This will allow us to make all necessary fixes to the course during its next release cycle.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-Projects"><a href="#Creating-Projects" class="headerlink" title="Creating Projects"></a>Creating Projects</h1><p>Before you can start building anything on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, you first need a project. Projects allow you to easily organize all the resources in your account. Every time you create a compute, storage or network resource, you will need to assign it to a project. Projects also contain their own unique set of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a>, APIs, and billing account information.</p>
<p>So let’s say you wanted to build a blog for sharing photos. You would start out by creating a new project. Let’s say you named it “Photo blog”. You then would start adding some resources to it. First, you might add a Compute Engine instance for running WordPress. Then a Cloud SQL database for storing your posts. And finally a Cloud Storage bucket for hosting the photos. All three of these resources would be linked to the project “Photo blog”. Other projects would be set up in a similar fashion. In this way, you can easily tell which of your resources belong to “Photo blog” and which belong to other projects.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out, creating projects might feel like an unnecessary step. However, the value quickly becomes apparent as you start building more and more. Organizing your resources into projects means that you won’t have to scroll through a thousand Virtual Machines to find the one you are looking for. Also, it means that you won’t accidentally get a production database confused with a development database. Finally, it will make your life easier when you need to shut down a project. You won’t have to track down each individual resource and manually delete it. When you delete a project, all associated resources are deleted as well.</p>
<p>And that is just a few. There are many other advantages. For example, security is greatly enhanced. Just because one project has access to an API, does not mean all your projects need access. The same is true for users. Not every user account needs the same level of permissions to every project. If you are going to be building anything substantial, you really need to get comfortable with creating and organizing Google Cloud Projects.</p>
<p>So now that you understand the importance of projects, let me demonstrate how to work with them in the GCP console. It’s actually pretty simple. If you want to try to follow along, you will need admin access to a GCP account. Remember, you can always sign up for a free trial at cloud.google.com.</p>
<p>Once you first log in, your screen should look similar to this. If you just created your account, then a default project has already been set up for you. It’s called “My First Project”. You can use this project, but eventually, you will want more. So let’s go through the process of creating a new project.</p>
<p>The console usually has multiple ways of accomplishing the same goal. For example, here you could click on the project selector drop-down menu at the top of the screen. And then you can click on the “New Project” button here. Or you can also go to the Navigation menu, click “IAM &amp; Admin”, and then on “Manage Resources”. From here you can see all of your projects. You might see more or less here, depending on if this is a new account or if not. I just created this account and have not defined any organizations, so it’s mostly empty except for the one default project. </p>
<p>The obvious next step is to click the “Create Project” button. Now I need to pick a project name. This can be whatever you want. Usually, I try to pick a name that describes what I am planning to build. For this example, let’s go with “Photo Blog”.</p>
<p>When you create a new project, a Project ID is automatically generated for you based upon the Project Name. Usually, it will contain the name of the project and have a random number appended to the end. The Project Name is purely for your benefit. It can be whatever you want. You can change it at any time. And it does not need to be unique. </p>
<p>The Project ID is for uniquely identifying your project. This allows GCP to distinguish your project from all others. That also means your Project ID needs to be globally unique. The ID cannot be the same as any other projects in any other account. You can see that it is possible to try to pick your own ID, but generally, I would recommend against it. It’s going to be hard to pick something clever that has not already been used by someone else. Instead, pick a good name and let Google generate the ID for you.</p>
<p>You are also asked to pick a location. If you have a more complicated setup with folders or multiple organizations, you will need to pick the correct one. But since this is a new, personal account I don’t have any of that. I will just leave it set to the default.</p>
<p>Once I click “Create”, the project will be created.</p>
<p>After creating a project, you can view the details on the Project info card on the Dashboard. You also can switch between projects by clicking on the project selector drop-down at the top of the page. Now that I have switched to the “Photo blog” project, anything I build will be assigned to that project.</p>
<p>When you no longer have use for a project, you can delete it. A project is marked for deletion for 30 days before it is actually deleted. This gives you some time to recover a project if you accidentally deleted it, or if you change your mind later. While the project is marked for deletion, it is unusable; however, its resources still count against your project quota until it is deleted. If a billing account is assigned to the project, the project may not be deleted until the current billing cycle ends.</p>
<p>To shut down a project, open the Nav menu, click on “IAM and Admin”, then click “Manage Resources”. Then simply select the Project and click the “Delete” button at the top of the page. Then you will get a confirmation warning about deleting a project. To confirm deleting, enter the Project ID. And finally, click the “Shut down” button. Be aware that deleting a project will not allow you to reuse the same Project ID. Once you use a project ID, that ID can never be used again by anyone.</p>
<p>A deleted project can be restored, as long as you do it before the end of the 30-day shutdown period. To restore a project, simply click on the “Resources Pending Deletion” button. Find the deleted project or projects that you want to restore, and select them. Then click the “Restore” link at the top of the page. And finally, confirm that you wish to restore the project by clicking the “Restore” button. So if we go back, we can confirm that the project is no longer marked for deletion.</p>
<p>So now you know how to create, delete and restore cloud projects. If you have access to a GCP account, you may want to try creating and deleting a few projects yourself to get familiar with the process.</p>
<h1 id="Adding-Users"><a href="#Adding-Users" class="headerlink" title="Adding Users"></a>Adding Users</h1><p>Typically, companies will have many different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">projects</a> with many different users working on them. And those users will often have different needs. For example, some users might need access to every project, while others might only need to access one or two. Some users will just need the ability to just look at things, while others might also need to make changes. That is why every project in your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a> account has its own set of users. And each user account can have its own unique set of permissions.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating new user accounts, you have a couple of options. First, you can manually create them yourself. This works fine if you have a small number of users. However, for large companies with hundreds or thousands of users, you may want to consider automating the process.  If you already have something like Active Directory or LDAP, you can use Google Cloud Directory Sync to automatically replicate them to Google Cloud Identity. Cloud Identity allows you to manage and authorize your user accounts across multiple applications and projects. It also supports SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), as well as two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose, you have full control over which permissions are granted to your users. This is accomplished by assigning roles. Roles are groups of permissions. You could try to directly assign individual permissions to users, but this would take a lot of time. Users typically need many, many different types of permissions to do their jobs. So to save time, you instead assign permissions to roles. And then you assign roles to users. </p>
<p>Now there are three main types of roles: basic, predefined, and custom. Basic and predefined roles are already created for you by Google. Custom roles are roles that you can create yourself.</p>
<p>Basic roles (formerly called primitive roles) represent a very simple and broad set of permissions. The Browser role allows a user to view what resources already exist, but not get any detailed information. The Viewer role allows a user to get more detailed information about resources, but not modify them. The Editor role allows a user to modify resources, but not other user accounts. And the Owner role gives a user full control. Owners can modify any resource or user account, and can also do things like set up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">billing</a>. It is generally recommended that you avoid using basic roles, especially in production <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">environments</a>. Basic roles typically either grant too many or not enough permissions.</p>
<p>Predefined roles provide smaller sets of permissions for specific resources. And because of this, there are many, many more predefined roles than basic ones. For example, if a user needed to be able to inventory all the compute engine resources, you could grant them the “Compute Viewer” predefined role. This would only allow them to view the current Compute Resources. If a user needed to modify firewall rules, you could grant them the “Compute Security Admin” predefined role. And if a user needed full control over all Compute Engine resources including VMs, security, and storage, you could grant them the “Compute Admin” predefined role.</p>
<p>The third type of role is the custom role. Custom roles are groups of permissions that can be as wide or as restricted as you wish. Predefined roles cover many typical scenarios, but can still end up granting unnecessary permissions. By defining your own Custom roles, you can assign exactly the permissions each user needs and no more.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough talk. Time to demonstrate how to create user accounts and assign roles. First, go to the Navigation menu and select “IAM &amp; Admin” and then “IAM”. Right now I just have a single user account for myself. This is the account I am using right now. Let’s add a few more.</p>
<p>Before creating a new user, always double-check that you have the right project selected. You don’t want to accidentally add a user to the wrong project. </p>
<p>Next, click the “Add” button at the top of the page. First, you will need to enter the user’s email address. So let me do that. Second, you need to pick at least one role to assign. There are the three main types of roles I talked about before. You can find Basic roles here. For this first user I will pick “Browser”. And once you click on “Save” the user will be created. So now the person with the email address of newuser1@gmail can log in and browse the resources inside of my “Photo blog” project.</p>
<p>Next, let’s add another user with some predefined roles. I will enter another email address. You can find the predefined roles down here under “All roles”. You can see that there are a lot more predefined roles than basic. There are so many, that it is often helpful to use the filter to search for the roles you are interested in. I can search for “App Engine” and get a list of App Engine related roles. So let me assign the App Engine Viewer role. You can also add more roles. You aren’t just limited to one. So let me add another predefined role. I’ll pick “BigQuery Data Viewer”. And then click “Save”.</p>
<p>So I have assigned basic and predefined roles. Let’s create a third user and assign custom roles. I have already created a few custom roles before I started filming so you could see how this work. If you want to create a new role, you can click on the “Manage Roles” link below. I’m going to assign Custom Role 1.  And also Custom Role 2. So now you know how to add new user accounts to your project. </p>
<p>Really quickly, I want to also show you how to create your own custom roles. If you select “Roles” from the side menu, you will see a list of the predefined and custom roles that exist. From here you just need to click on “Create Role” at the top of the page and you can pick a title (which is the name) and then add permissions. There are a lot of permissions to choose from, so you can also search and filter by name. I am just going to pick a few permissions at random.</p>
<p>So this new custom role is called “Custom Role 3”. It is going to have 4 assigned permissions. And once I click “Create” it will be available to use.</p>
<p>There are going to be times when you want to delete a user.  Luckily, deleting is pretty simple. Let’s go back to the IAM page. You just select the users, and then click the “Remove” button at the top of the page. Confirm that, yes, you wish to remove the users from the project. And that is all there is to it. The user accounts have been deleted.</p>
<p>As you can see, creating users and assigning them roles is fairly straightforward. The real trick is understanding what permissions your users will need. It depends on what you are building and what your requirements are. Remember, you can always change permissions later. So it is recommended to start out assigning the minimum amount of permissions at first. Then you can add more later as required. It is safer to give out too few, than too many.</p>
<p>And that wraps up the lesson on users and roles. If you can, I recommend creating a few users with different levels of permissions. Then try to log in as each and take note of the limitations on what you can see and do. </p>
<h1 id="Enabling-APIs"><a href="#Enabling-APIs" class="headerlink" title="Enabling APIs"></a>Enabling APIs</h1><p>In order to access certain Google Cloud resources, you may need to enable the corresponding API. Google Cloud APIs are application programming interfaces that give you access to certain Google Cloud services. APIs for common tasks are enabled by default. But many APIs are disabled and need to be explicitly enabled for your project before you can start using them.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing an application that interacts with a user’s Google Calendar. In order to add or modify events, you would need to enable the Google Calendar API. You can find a complete list of all APIs at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/apis">https://cloud.google.com/apis</a>. When you enable an API, the corresponding monitoring pages and billing properties are also added to your project.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate how to enable an API for a project. First, verify that you have the correct project selected in the drop down. Then go to the navigation menu and select “APIs &amp; Services” and “Dashboard”. This will show you all your currently enabled APIs. If you want to add a new one, click the “Enable APIs and Services” button at the top of the page. You can browse the list or search for the name. I’ll just pick the “Google Calendar API”. And then click the enable button. </p>
<p>Now some APIs require more than just enabling them. You might need to do some extra steps. For example, some will ask you to accept their terms of service. Others may require additional signup. Like here, I need to create some credentials to get it fully working. But we can verify that the API was enabled by going back to the Dashboard. And here we can see that the Google Calendar API has been enabled. </p>
<p>When you no longer have use for an API, you can disable it as well. To disable an API for your project, select the API. Then click the “Disable API” link at the top of the page. We can confirm it was disabled by double checking the dashboard. And there you go. The Google Calendar API is no longer listed.</p>
<p>Remember that you only want to enable the APIs you actually need in the projects that will use them. When an API is disabled, you can’t accidentally use it and avoid wasting money.</p>
<h1 id="Manage-Billing"><a href="#Manage-Billing" class="headerlink" title="Manage Billing"></a>Manage Billing</h1><p>Using Google Cloud Platform costs money. At the time of this recording, signing up for a free trial gets you $300 worth of credit for up to 90 days. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google</a> also has a free tier which gives you limited access to some GCP services as well. This free trial and free tier should provide enough to experiment with and learn, but eventually, you will need to start paying. This becomes especially true once you begin building and deploying production-ready workloads.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is important to understand how to set up billing, monitor your spending, and get detailed information on any charges. I will cover all of that in this lesson.</p>
<p>First, let me demonstrate how to add a new billing account to a project. Now if you signed up for an account, you already set up a billing by providing a credit card. But sometimes you will want to have your projects use different billing accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s start by clicking on “Billing” in the Nav menu. Then open the drop down and click on ”Manage billing accounts”. You can see my current billing account. I want to create a new one, so I will click on “Create Account”. You need to assign a name. Then select a country. This determines the currency you will be charged in. Now review the information in payments profile. It suggests using the credit card I previously entered. But I want to enter a different one, It already has my name and billing address, so I don’t need to add those. Finally, click “Submit and Enable Billing”.  And you can see that I now have two billing accounts, instead of just one.</p>
<p>Next, I want to link my new billing account to one of my projects. Click on “Account Management” to view the projects that are currently linked to your billing account. Since this is the new account, no projects are listed. I need to select the old account, to see my current projects. Now I can modify my “Photo blog” project to use the new billing account. Let me jump back to the new billing account. And we confirm that “Photo blog” is linked to it.</p>
<p>You can also disable billing. To disable billing for a project, click the Actions button to the right of the project you want to change. Then select “Disable billing”. And confirm by clicking the “Disable Billing” button. When you disable billing it simply stops automatic payments. You are still responsible for all outstanding charges for the project. So if you want to make sure you do not receive any more charges, you should also delete the project.</p>
<p>So now that you understand how to manage billing accounts, let’s cover setting a budget. Setting a budget does not create a hard cap on spending. You can still spend more than what the budget allows. Think about it. You would NOT want a production system to suddenly shut down because it exceeded it’s budget. Budgets are used for generating alerts when costs begin to rise. If you want to actually stop spending, you will need to delete the project.</p>
<p>To create a budget for a project, from the Billing page, click on “Budgets and alerts”. Then click on “Create Budget”. You will need to give your new budget a name. Then select the scope for your budget to cover. In this case, I will leave it set to “All services”. You can also tell it to filter out any discounts or promotions if you wish.</p>
<p>Next, you specify the amount of your budget. For this example, I will pick $100 because it is a nice round number.</p>
<p>Under actions, you define how and when you will be notified. By default, administrators and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a> with billing account roles will receive email alerts when the amount spent exceeds 50%, 90%, and 100% of the budget. You can change or add more thresholds if you wish. Let me add a new notification at 25%. Remember, the budget won’t actually cap your spending. Once you receive a notification, it is up to you to decide what to do.</p>
<p>You also can choose how you want to be notified. You can send emails or you can publish a message to a Pub&#x2F;Sub topic.</p>
<p>Click the Finish button and your budget will be set. Now I will get my first notification email when my spend exceeds $25. If you are using a free trial, you may want to create an alert so you do not end up getting an unexpected bill at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll show you how to generate a billing export for a project. Billing exports are detailed copies of your charges that live inside a BigQuery database. Once you have your charges in a database, you can easily filter and sort the details. You can also use DataStudio to create charts and graphs to generate reports.</p>
<p>To create a billing export, select “Billing export” from the Billing page. From here you can choose between the different types. I can pick either to export all my costs, or I can export any price changes. For this example, I want a full list of all my costs, so I’ll pick the first option.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll confirm the project I want to perform the export on. And then I have to pick a BigQuery table to export to. I do not have any BigQuery tables set up, so I will choose “Create New Dataset”. Now I have to pick a name for the new table. This must only include letters, numbers and underscores. Then I can pick where the data will reside. If you want, you can set an expiration date for the table. And finally, you can pick an encryption method. I do not want anything fancy, so I am going to stick with the defaults. Click the “Create Dataset” to confirm.</p>
<p>I can confirm that the new table has been created by clicking on the Dataset name. Now if I want, I can use BigQuery to view my bill details. I’m not going to actually demonstrate that, since using BigQuery is out of scope. If you understand how to write SQL queries, you shouldn’t have too much trouble accessing this information yourself.</p>
<p>So that’s it. You know the basics for managing billing on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">how to set up a Google Cloud Platform environment</a>. Let’s do a quick review. </p>
<p>First, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">create and delete projects</a>. You will use projects to manage and organize your GCP account.</p>
<p>Second, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">create user accounts</a> and to assign them permissions via roles. You should try to remember the three types of roles: Basic, Predefined, and Custom. Basic roles include the Browser, Viewer, Editor, and Owner roles. Basic roles are simple to use and understand, but not very secure to use in any sort of real environment. Predefined roles are more granular and are broken up into smaller groups of permissions. If a predefined role matches your need, use that. Otherwise, you can create your own custom roles for when you need something special. It is highly recommended that you avoid using basic roles, and choose predefined or custom roles instead.</p>
<p>Third, we covered enabling APIs to give you access to different Google services. These services include all kinds of things, including compute, storage, networking, and many more. You can control which resources a project has access to by enabling or disabling the associated API.</p>
<p>Fourth, I showed you how to add a billing account. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">Billing accounts</a> allow you to specify how you will pay for the services consumed in each project. Projects can share the same billing account, or can have different accounts, depending upon your needs. You can set up spending alerts for a project by setting a budget. And you analyze your spending habits by performing a billing export.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the GCP Resource Manager documentation and trying out some of the “How-to guides” at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager">https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager</a>.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-GCP"><a href="#What-is-GCP" class="headerlink" title="What is GCP?"></a>What is GCP?</h1><p>Before I start talking about its services, I first want to explain exactly what Google Cloud Platform is. Google Cloud Platform (often abbreviated as GCP) is a public cloud vendor. This means it is a collection of virtual, on-demand services that anyone can use to build, host, and deliver applications. The main advantage of using GCP is that it gives you access to the same hardware and software that Google uses to host all of its services. This includes Google Search, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs. In addition to the global network, you also get to leverage Google’s vast experience with serving applications to billions of people all around the world.</p>
<p>With Google Cloud Platform, you are spared the hassle and cost of building and maintaining your own data centers. Everything is on-demand. Any resources you need are available wherever you need them to be, and they can be accessed at any time. Plus, GCP has hundreds of different services to choose from: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Internet of Things, Healthcare, Gaming. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>The number of options available is almost overwhelming. That is why in this course, I am going to be giving you a virtual tour of the main offerings. I have divided everything into five main categories: </p>
<ol>
<li>Compute</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>AI &amp; ML</li>
<li>Security &amp; Operations</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next few lessons, we will go through each category in more detail. </p>
<h1 id="Compute"><a href="#Compute" class="headerlink" title="Compute"></a>Compute</h1><p>In this lesson, I am going to cover the main “Compute” offerings available on Google Cloud Platform. Compute services are services used for running code. So, maybe you have purchased some software and you need the hardware to run it. Or maybe you are developing your own custom software and need machines to build and test it. Any project that requires processing power and memory can take advantage of a Compute service.</p>
<p>When most people think about Cloud computing, they immediately think of virtual machines. You can configure virtual machines to do pretty much anything you want. Google’s main service for creating your own VMs is called Compute Engine. Compute Engine VMs can either run Linux or Windows. And there are many different predefined machine types to choose from, each with different amounts of processing power and memory. General-purpose machines offer the best price-performance ratio. While optimized machines offer higher levels of performance for either compute, memory or graphics. You can also create custom machine types as well.</p>
<p>Compute Engine is “Infrastructure-as-a-Service”. That means you can use it to build pretty much whatever you want. You can spin up a powerful Windows instance and install SQL Server. Or you can spin up a smaller Linux instance and install Apache web server. The possibilities are near endless.</p>
<p>So that’s great if you want to build everything from scratch, but what if you want to move over some existing infrastructure? Luckily, Google has made it easy to migrate. If you are currently using VMware, then you can use Google Cloud VMware Engine to run any existing VMs. Now if you are running bare metal servers or have another type of VM, then you can migrate those over to Compute Engine using Migrate for Compute Engine. This service makes it really fast and easy to move your workloads over. It creates a new instance on GCP while copying the data from your original VM. Once the data transfer is finished, the GCP instance reboots, and then your migration is complete. In addition to VMware and physical machines, Migrate for Compute Engine can also support VMs running on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Virtual machines are not the only compute resource. These days, containers have become increasingly popular. Containers are somewhat like virtual machines, except they don’t include the operating system. This means that they lose a little bit of flexibility, but the upside is that containers are much more lightweight. They take up less disk space and they are faster to start up and shut down.</p>
<p>Google Kubernetes Engine (or GKE) is used for running containers on Google. It makes it easy to deploy, maintain and scale your containerized applications. It also includes features for logging, monitoring, and health management. Now, some people want to spread out their containers to run across multiple cloud providers. And Google has created a product just for this. This is called Anthos. With Anthos, you can run many different containers across multiple locations. So you could have some running on-premises, some on GCP, and some on AWS.  Anthos provides a single command interface that controls and monitors everything. So if you are building a hybrid environment, you might want to check Anthos out. </p>
<p>If you are interested in converting some of your VMs to containers. Google makes this easy with Migrate for Anthos. Just pick a VM and it will be transformed into a GKE container. You can also combine Migrate for Compute Engine with Migrate for Anthos to convert a physical server to a container, if you wish.</p>
<p>While Compute Engine (CE) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) give you a lot of power, they do require quite a lot of work. You have to provision instances. You have to be able to pick the right machine types. You have to apply the latest patches and security updates. If you already know how to do all this, then it is probably not a big deal. But a lot of times customers don’t know and don’t care about this level of detail. This is where Google’s “serverless” options come in. </p>
<p>Google has a “Platform-as-a-Service” offering called App Engine. App Engine lets you run web and mobile applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. You just upload your code and let GCP take care of the rest. It will provision and scale the underlying resources up and down automatically. When there is little to no traffic, App Engine will scale down so that you are charged less. When your app starts receiving lots of traffic, it will scale up to handle the load. Compute Engine gives you far more control and flexibility. But App Engine provides simplicity and ease-of-use.</p>
<p>Similarly, Google has a serverless offering for containers, called Cloud Run. If you have a complex application that involves many different containers, then you’ll probably want to stick with using GKE. But if your application runs inside a single container, then Cloud Run is much easier to use.  Just upload your container and let Cloud Run deploy it as a stateless, auto scaling service.</p>
<p>So App Engine is for running applications and Cloud Run is for running containers. But what if you just want to call a simple function? Well, there is a third serverless option for that as well. Cloud Functions can create small, single-purpose functions that respond to events. For example, you could configure a Cloud Function to be triggered whenever a file is uploaded or whenever a database is changed. Cloud Functions are great for adding a little extra functionality without having to create something far more complicated.</p>
<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to run a Windows application, you should pick Compute Engine.</li>
<li>If you want to run a Java or Python app, then App Engine would probably be the best choice.</li>
<li>For running a single container, I would choose Cloud Run.</li>
<li>For a multiple container application, then you probably want to choose GKE.</li>
<li>Unless you also want to distribute your containers across multiple cloud vendors, then you would pick Anthos.</li>
<li>And if you just want to run a simple function whenever an event occurs, Cloud Functions would be the right tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that should cover all the main Compute offerings on GCP.</p>
<h1 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h1><p>In this lesson, I am going to cover the main “Storage” services available on Google Cloud Platform. </p>
<p>Storage services are all about storing data. Different types of data require different types of services. For example, data can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured. Structured data is composed of clearly defined data types and patterns. Think of stuff like names, dates and credit card numbers. Structured data is easy to search and usually is kept in a relational database. Unstructured data is just the opposite. It is more freeform and has no obvious organization. So think about things like music, photos and video.</p>
<p>When most people think of storage, they probably think of files in a filesystem. This would be an excellent example of unstructured data. If you want to read and write files to the cloud, then you can use Google Cloud Storage. Cloud Storage is perfect for serving web pages, archiving log files, or you can even use it as a data lake. A data lake is basically a repository of raw data that can be used for later analysis or machine learning. Essentially, it is just a really big collection of unorganized data.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage is fast, secure, durable, and has almost unlimited capacity. Because there are different types of unstructured data, Cloud Storage offers several different storage classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standard storage is best for short-lived or frequently accessed data. This class costs the most, but there is no minimum for length of storage.</li>
<li>Nearline storage is best when you need to store things for a longer period of time (at least 30-days) and need to access it less frequently (eg: once per month or less). Files stored in nearline will cost less than standard.</li>
<li>Coldline storage is even cheaper, but it has a longer storage minimum (90 days) and should only be used for files you need to access four times a year or less.</li>
<li>Archive storage is the cheapest. This is the best choice when you need to keep files for a long time due to compliance. Archive storage must be kept for at least 365 days, and it should only be accessed less than once a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>All four storage classes give you immediate access to your files. This is different from some other cloud providers, where the lowest cost storage can take hours to access.</p>
<p>Now while it stores files, Cloud Storage does not work exactly like a traditional file system. It is considered “object storage”. So there are no actual directories, and everything is kept inside “buckets”. You also cannot edit or update part of a file. You can only delete and recreate it. If you need “block level” storage access with a true hierarchical structure, you can use Filestore instead.  Filestore can be used to create NFS-compatible file shares that can be mounted on your virtual machines and containers. If you just want to store and share files, Cloud Storage is perfect. But if you need lower level block access or say you need to constantly append data to the end of a file, Firestore is a much better match.</p>
<p>Now these options are fine if you just want to store your data in files. But what about databases? Well Google has several services for those too. If you want to store structured data inside organized tables, columns and rows (much like a traditional SQL database) then Cloud SQL could be a good choice. It is fully-managed by Google, so it is very easy to get started. And it supports the most common database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. So if you are already using one of those, you can easily migrate to Cloud SQL and then let Google manage the details for you. Cloud SQL is perfect for storing data you need to sort, transform, and search.</p>
<p>If for some reason Cloud SQL isn’t powerful enough, then Google offers something even better: Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner is unique because it is a relational database that’s massively scalable. You can get much higher performance than Cloud SQL, however it comes with a higher cost. Cloud Spanner is for companies that need an extremely powerful, multi-regional database that can handle a heavy amount of I&#x2F;O.</p>
<p>Finally, if you need to store and work with structured “Big Data” (which is extremely large and complex data sets) then BigQuery might be your best bet. BigQuery is Google’s data warehouse service. Now, a data warehouse stores data from multiple sources, including data lakes and databases, and can be used to analyze huge, multidimensional datasets. Databases are optimized for transactions. But data warehouses are optimized for analytics. BigQuery can process petabytes of data and it integrates with many other services. For example, Looker (a business intelligence solution) works with BigQuery to help you explore your data and share insights in real time.</p>
<p>Of course, Google also supports non-relational or “NoSQL” databases as well. NoSQL databases do not use tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize data and are particularly useful for storing unstructured data. NoSQL supports flexible data models, it scales horizontally, and it has incredibly fast queries. However, searching, sorting and joining data is much more limited.</p>
<p>There are three main options here, and they include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firestore, which is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications</li>
<li>Firebase, which is best for syncing data between users in real-time, such as in collaboration apps</li>
<li>Bigtable, which is best for running large analytical workloads</li>
</ol>
<p>Time to summarize the main storage options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you need to store files for sharing, then Cloud Storage will probably be your best option.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you need to edit and update files, then you might want to look at using Filestore. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For SQL databases you have three main choices:</p>
</li>
<li><ol>
<li>Cloud SQL is great for when you need a standard MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Cloud Spanner will handle larger workloads that Cloud SQL can’t</li>
<li>Big Query is great for creating a data warehouse for analytics</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>You also have three choices when it comes to noSQL databases as well:</p>
</li>
<li><ol>
<li>Firestore is great for smaller applications (such as web and mobile)</li>
<li>Firebase is better for larger datasets</li>
<li>Bigtable is best for running very large analytical workloads</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That should cover the main storage offerings on GCP. </p>
<h1 id="Networking"><a href="#Networking" class="headerlink" title="Networking"></a>Networking</h1><p>In this lesson, I am going to cover the main “Networking” offerings on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>Google networking services are focused on allowing your other resources to connect and communicate. Your Compute and Storage resources can be as accessible or isolated as you need. You can reroute traffic when a VMs fails. Or throttle high traffic so that a database is not overwhelmed. Also, networking services include setting policies and rules that ensure that only authorized connections are allowed.</p>
<p>Virtual Private Clouds (or VPC for short) allow you to organize and share your resources. VPCs are networks that are logically isolated from each other. VPCs can be used to group or separate VMs and containers. You can also divide a VPC into sub-networks, define routes, and specify how traffic should flow between them.</p>
<p>By default, all incoming traffic to a VPC is blocked, and all outgoing traffic is allowed. This protects your VPC from outside access, but allows your resources to still connect to the internet. By creating firewall rules, you have the ability to override this default behavior. So you can block outbound traffic in case you want to prevent a resource from accessing the internet. Or you can allow external access to a public web server. You can also control which VPCs can connect to each other using a service called VPC Network Peering.</p>
<p>Now, what if you want to connect a VPC to an external network outside of Google? For example, maybe you wish to route traffic between your own private data centers. There are several ways of accomplishing this. First, you can create a secure connection to a VPC using Cloud VPN. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A VPN uses the public internet to send encrypted traffic back and forth. This works, but it does mean that any slowdown or disruption of the internet can affect your internal connections as well. So, if you want even greater security and reliability, you can use Cloud Interconnect instead. Cloud Interconnect is much more expensive than a VPN, but it provides a direct, dedicated connection to Google which results in higher speed and reliability. Now as a third option, you can also choose Direct Peering by coordinating with your local internet service provider. Peering is free, but it depends on your ISP. It’s not really well-integrated with GCP and requires a lot more setup.</p>
<p>Google has many other networking services as well. For example, Load Balancers help distribute network traffic among groups of resources, so that no individual part of your infrastructure gets overwhelmed. Cloud Armor works with your load balancers to provide built-in defenses against application and Denial of Service attacks. Cloud DNS allows you to create and manage millions of DNS records, for both public and private domains. And Cloud CDN can accelerate your web and application content by using Google’s globally distributed caches.</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s do a quick review of everything that was covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>You group your VMs into VPCs and then create firewall rules to isolate or connect them to the internet</li>
<li>Cloud VPN, Interconnect, and Peering all can be used to connect your corporate network to GCP</li>
<li>Load balancers are used for distributing traffic across multiple resources</li>
<li>Cloud Armor helps block internet attacks</li>
<li>Cloud DNS manages domain names</li>
<li>Cloud CDN uses caching to accelerate content delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>So those are the most commonly used Networking services on GCP.</p>
<h1 id="Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"></a>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h1><p>In this lesson, I want to talk about some of the most exciting services in GCP: that is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Google is known for being on the cutting edge of this space. The world was shocked when its AlphaGo software defeated one of the best human players of the board game, Go.</p>
<p>For those who don’t already know, Artificial intelligence (usually abbreviated as AI) is a field of study that attempts to give machines the same level of intelligence that humans possess. Essentially, the goal of AI is to create machines that are capable of acting on their own, without direct human intervention. Now AI is sort of a wider field of study, where Machine Learning (or ML) is a specific branch in that field. Machine learning is mostly focused on developing systems that can learn. Now by “learn”, I mean that they use large amounts of data to slowly improve their responses.</p>
<p>Currently, Google divides its AI and ML services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data.</p>
<p>Under Sight, they have services like the Vision API, which can detect objects, faces, and text in images. The Video Intelligence API recognizes objects, places, and actions in video. Document AI uses machine learning to help you parse and identify data inside your documents, such as company names, addresses, and phone numbers.</p>
<p>Under Language, they have the Translation API, which can convert text from one language to another. It currently supports over one hundred different languages. They also have the Natural Language API, which performs tasks like sentiment analysis. For example, it can classify a message as being either positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
<p>The Conversation category includes the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs, which do exactly what you would expect. It also includes a service called DialogFlow, which can generate realistic sounding dialogue. Using DialogFlow, you can build chatbots and voicebots to handle things like customer support requests.</p>
<p>The last category is Structured Data. These services allow you to feed in structured data and get back insights. For example, the Recommendations AI can look at a customer’s previous purchases and recommend other products that they might be interested in buying. Also, Cloud Talent Solutions can automatically detect and understand job content and applicant intent. Candidates can quickly find the most appropriate jobs, while companies can identify, attract and hire quality candidates.</p>
<p>All of these prebuilt AI services have been trained based on general sets of data, so they might not be able to handle your specific needs. Now for these scenarios, Google provides its AutoML suite of services. For example, you might need to identify product defects in your factory assembly lines. By feeding your own data into AutoML Vision, you can train a custom model without having to know machine learning.</p>
<p>If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use Vertex AI (which was previously named the AI Platform suite). It includes many different services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction. The Training service lets you train custom models using popular Python-based frameworks. Or you can also access a repository of plug-and-play AI components (including end-to-end AI pipelines and out-of-the-box algorithms) by using AI Hub.</p>
<p>Alright, so let’s review all the AI and ML services I just talked about. Remember, you got the four main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sight services, including the Vision API, Document API, and Video Intelligence API</li>
<li>Language services, including the Translation API and Natural Language API</li>
<li>Conversation services, include Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text and DialogFlow</li>
<li>Structured Data services, including Recommendations AI and Talent Solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, remember, if the standard APIs are not enough, you can also train your own models using AutoML. And you can access AI Hub for plug-and-play AI components as well. And that should cover the main AI &amp; ML services on GCP.</p>
<h1 id="Security-and-Operations"><a href="#Security-and-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Security and Operations"></a>Security and Operations</h1><p>In this lesson, I am going to talk about some of the Security and Operations services available on GCP.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about security. Security services exist to help you protect your data. One of the main concerns with using the cloud is privacy. You want to be able to control exactly who can access your data. So privacy is the goal, and security is the method. Google security services allow you to define policies, procedures, and controls that everyone must follow. In order to protect your customers and your company, you need to properly implement security. The policies you define will often be shaped by compliance requirements. Compliance refers to a third party set of standards, usually by some sort of regulatory authority. For example, different countries have different laws about storing and encrypting data. Digital security is complicated, so there are many different GCP services to assist you.</p>
<p>Security Command Center provides a centralized control panel to help you discover vulnerabilities, detect threats, and generate reports. Secret Manager gives you centralized storage for things like passwords, API keys, and certificates. The Data Loss Prevention service helps you identify and scrub sensitive data. For example, if your user records contain credit card numbers, you could configure DLP to remove them before responding to a database query.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about operation services. Now operations is focused on monitoring and maintaining your existing infrastructure. </p>
<p>So you have things like Google Cloud Operations Suite which was previously called Stackdriver. Now this suite includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cloud Logging: This acts as a centralized repository for all your logs. It makes it easy to find your logs and to search the entries for any messages you are interested in. </li>
<li>Cloud Monitoring: This gives you an overview of everything that is happening. You can view metrics like CPU utilization, response latency, and network traffic. Plus, you can use it to set up alerts to notify you where there are any problems. If a metric is too low or too high, you will know about it right away.</li>
<li>Cloud Debugger: This helps you easily track down software bugs by allowing you to inspect the state of a running application.</li>
<li>Cloud Profiler: This can be used to identify latency issues inside of an application.</li>
<li>Cloud Trace: This helps you track down latency issues that exist between two or more applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now there are other operation tools as well. These include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Deployment Manager which allows you to write templates and then use those to provision resources. You can have a template for creating a VM, and then run it 20 times to get 20 VMs. This is extremely useful for when you need to create a lot of the same resources. Now you no longer have to create everything by hand. </li>
<li>Cloud Build is a tool that can help automate building, testing and deploying your code. </li>
<li>Apigee helps you design secure and scale application programming interfaces (or APIs). This way your web services can easily communicate with each other.</li>
<li>Cloud Composer can be used to create, schedule, monitor, and manage workflows that span across clouds and on-premises data centers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so let’s quickly review the Security and Operations services I just talked about:</p>
<p>Under Security, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security Command Center provides a centralized overview of security issues</li>
<li>Secret Manager for storing passwords and keys</li>
<li>Data Loss Prevention for identifying and hiding sensitive data</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Operations, we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cloud Operations Suite</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Includes Logging &amp; Monitoring</li>
<li>Debugging for finding bugs in an app</li>
<li>Profiling for identifying slowdowns in an app</li>
<li>Trace for identifying bottlenecks between applications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment Manager for creating templates and automating infrastructure changes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Build for automating software deployments</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apigee for building APIs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Composer for managing workflows</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that just about covers the main Security and Operations services available on GCP.</p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to “Modernize your IT Department with Google Cloud Platform”. My name is Daniel Mease and I’ll be taking you through this course. I am a trainer at Cloud Academy with over 20 years of software and web development experience. This course is intended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone interested in learning about the benefits of Cloud Computing</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing this course, you will understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>How GCP can be used to modernize your business as well as </li>
<li>The benefits and costs of modernization</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the following prerequisites will helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should already have a Basic understanding of cloud principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback on our courses is valuable, both to us as trainers and our future students. If you have any criticisms or suggestions for improvement, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share those with us.</p>
<p>Please note that, when this video was recorded, all course information was accurate. Google is constantly updating its products and services as part of its ongoing drive to innovate. As a result, over time, minor discrepancies may appear in the course content. Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content up to date in order to provide the best training available. </p>
<p>So, if you notice any information that is outdated, please contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. This will allow us to make all necessary fixes to the course during its next release cycle.</p>
<h1 id="Digital-Transformation"><a href="#Digital-Transformation" class="headerlink" title="Digital Transformation"></a>Digital Transformation</h1><p>If you are taking this course, then you should already be aware of some of the benefits of using the cloud. Most people have tried out at least one of Google’s services (Google Search, GMail, Android Phone, or Google Docs) and so you have already had a taste of the scale and power available. Today these products reliably and consistently serve over a billion users worldwide. Google has spent incredible amounts of time and money building up its infrastructure. And today that very same infrastructure is available to you.</p>
<p>So you have seen what the cloud has done for Google. But today I want to talk about what the cloud can do for you. If you are building a company from scratch, then starting out on the cloud makes a lot of sense. A startup needs flexibility and agility. Today you are going to try something, and tomorrow could be completely different. This makes the cloud a perfect fit. However, what if your company has been around for a while? You might have an extensive history, and that usually comes with layers of legacy hardware and software. Switching to the cloud certainly will take more effort. However, even well-established companies can gain many benefits.</p>
<p>Technology changes rapidly. Anything built today becomes obsolete tomorrow. If your company has been around for more than a few years you probably have a lot of outdated, but mission-critical systems. Everything was built for the needs of the past, and your existing infrastructure may not have the speed, scale or flexibility to meet the needs of tomorrow. Probably one of your main struggles is balancing maintenance of the old with the creation of the new. You need some way to keep your existing systems up and running, while also being able to make significant changes for growth. A lot of companies simply do not have the resources to do both well at the same time. In order to keep up, you need a paradigm shift. A complete “digital transformation” if you will.</p>
<p>Today, customers expect everything to be fast, accessible from anywhere, and to have almost no downtime. If your offering is slow, then your customers will switch to a faster competitor. If your service is restricted to certain geographic regions, then you limit your market share. You also risk alienating international customers who may operate in multiple regions. And if your service goes down unexpectedly, then you could be sacrificing your reputation, your customer satisfaction, and your revenue.</p>
<p>Google has set a high bar. In order to keep up with modern demands, you need to offer the same level of speed, scale and security. And what better way to accomplish this, than by using the exact same infrastructure and tools?</p>
<h1 id="Benefits-of-Modernization"><a href="#Benefits-of-Modernization" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Modernization"></a>Benefits of Modernization</h1><p>The end goal of digital transformation is modernization. Now when it comes to modernizing your IT department, there are three primary areas to focus on: infrastructure, business platforms, and applications.</p>
<p>Your first area of focus should be on modernizing your infrastructure. This involves replacing your existing physical systems with virtual infrastructure in the cloud. Think about it.  If your company needs a car, it probably doesn’t make sense to build your own. Instead, you want to lease a car built by a company of experts. So why would you spend so many resources on building a custom data center, when you could instead lease the resources from infrastructure experts? Wouldn’t it make more sense to leverage Google’s existing world-class knowledge, hardware, and support? That way you can free yourself up to focus on your true competitive advantages.</p>
<p>Switching to a modern infrastructure removes so many limitations. You now have infinite room to grow. You are not going to run out of disk space or bandwidth anytime soon. You aren’t going to run out of physical space either. You no longer have to think about expanding your current data center or adding new ones. You can move things around anywhere in the world with just a few clicks. And significant infrastructure changes no longer require your staff to run around switching cables and re-racking servers.</p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about rapid spikes in demand. If you need an extra 100 servers, you can get those right now. Think about how long it would take you to purchase and install those yourself. Plus, if you decide later you no longer need them, then just stop using them and you are no longer charged. You are freed from being forced to make these huge, risky expenditures. In fact, you can even adjust your resources dynamically in real-time. That means your company can handle increased holiday traffic, without needing to purchase a bunch of extra hardware.  By modernizing your infrastructure, you remove many barriers to growth.</p>
<p>Modern infrastructure also provides new possibilities. When you don’t have to worry about storage and bandwidth restrictions, then you can start to collect and process more data. Businesses often have access to a lot of data, but most of it gets thrown away or ignored. This includes data about your customer’s purchasing habits. Data about how well your services are performing. Data about how the public’s perception of your company. Storing and processing all this data will allow you to gain critical insights and improve your company value.  With Google’s business intelligence solutions, you can efficiently extract useful information in real-time from terabytes of data spread over multiple systems. </p>
<p>Also, Google’s Machine Learning tools can use this data to generate all sorts of predictive insights. Imagine being able to dynamically adjust your prices in real-time based on factors such as costs and market demand. Or being able to accurately predict the success of a new product line before actually building it. Of course, accurate predictions require accurate data. You need to collect a lot of high-quality data in order to be able to do this. So, as you can see, when traditional limitations are no longer holding you back, you can do so much more.</p>
<p>Modernizing your infrastructure can also improve your security. You no longer have to worry about physical damage. Fires, floods, blackouts. These all become Google’s headache, not yours. Your data can have multiple copies spread all over the world, and thus you never have to worry about losing anything ever again.</p>
<p>Google also has some of the best security professionals on the planet. Cyberattacks are on the rise and information security is more important than ever. Does your company currently have the expertise to fight off attacks from all over the world? As our systems become increasingly more connected, the potential surface of attack increases.  Employees can download a virus, bring a compromised phone to work, or plug in a compromised smart device in their office. Sometimes security issues can even come from a “trusted” third-party device. Do you have the expertise and experience necessary to ensure that everything in your data center is secure and kept up-to-date? Every time data is lost or compromised, you face some potentially serious repercussions. Viruses, leaked passwords, ransomware, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Google makes it easy to encrypt everything. Both data “at rest” (sitting on a hard drive) and “in flight” (traveling across a network). They offer extra protections as well such as Multi-Factor Authentication to verify a request is legitimate. And you can set up granular permissions to ensure that your employees can access only what is needed. There is complete visibility into every change made and every access request (whether it is approved or denied). Google’s data centers are closely monitored and secured from both physical and virtual intrusions. Google builds most of its own hardware, so third parties don’t even get a chance to tamper with it. And Google employs a huge team of security professionals to constantly monitor, fix and upgrade their systems.</p>
<p>The second area of focus is on modernizing your business platforms. Business platforms are built to enhance communication. This can be communication between several internal platforms. Or it can be about enhancing communication between your platform and a third party. Once your infrastructure lives in the cloud, integrating new software and services is even easier.</p>
<p>This is typically accomplished through APIs. API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs make it easy for systems to exchange information. You can use APIs to get access to new services that you yourself did not create. And you can build your own APIs to share your services with others. A good API will allow one party to securely submit a request and get a response. This could be for almost any kind of a service. There are APIs for charging credit cards, APIs for mapping out driving directions, and APIs for doing complicated date computations.</p>
<p>APIs can enable seamless experiences across multiple platforms. This is how you can log into GMail and still be logged in when you visit YouTube. Wouldn’t you like to learn more about your customer’s needs to deliver a more customized experience? APIs make it easier to integrate new services, collect and share information, and create robust and scalable systems. A modern business platform is much more flexible and scalable. It gives you the ability to add complex new functionalities without a major overhaul.</p>
<p>The third area of focus should be on modernizing your applications. This involves shifting them from running apps locally to running in the cloud. Now you can approach this in a number of ways. First, you can simply do a “lift and shift” which means changing your apps as little as possible, but just enough to get them to work on the cloud. Once you work out all the bugs and get everything to work exactly the way it did before, then you can start to make further enhancements and slowly add cloud-specific features. Second, you could follow a “brownfield” approach and completely rewrite your applications from scratch. But this time you design them to be cloud-ready from the beginning. This will increase the amount of time it takes to move over to the cloud, but should provide a much cleaner experience. Of course, if your existing applications need to be completely retired, you can always create brand new one’s using a “greenfield” approach. Your on-prem applications will be kept in place, and then retired once the new, cloud-optimized versions are ready to go live. Of course, if you don’t want to modify your applications at all, you could simply build a virtual environment in the cloud to match your existing environment and deploy your apps there instead.</p>
<p>Once you have modernized your applications, they are no longer bound by the limitations of legacy infrastructure. Your developers can focus more on adding features, instead of bypassing roadblocks. And by leveraging the development tools on GCP, it is easier and faster to build, test and deploy new changes without impacting your users or interfering with other systems. This results in less risk and more frequent updates.</p>
<p>Your developers and testers are often hamstrung in what they can do, because they have limited access to resources. Testing should ideally be done outside of production, but in an environment that looks and acts almost identical. But how many companies can afford to have a complete copy of production sitting around idle most of the time? Your developers need ways to experiment and try different ideas. But this often requires extra hardware, software, and permissions that are not available. What kind of budget can you afford to allocate to a dedicated lab environment? </p>
<p>In the cloud, this is a much easier problem to solve. You can create temporary copies of different environments that will run completely separately. Your testers can test and your developers can troubleshoot and experiment. And when they are done, you shut everything down. You don’t need to purchase any dedicated hardware. Just use what you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>Rolling out updates on the cloud is made much easier as well. You can automate your deployments so that any new change can be immediately tested. A Continuous Deployment&#x2F;Continuous Integration pipeline will make sure you identify bugs right away. Instead of making a few large, risky updates every year, you can make lots of smaller, safer ones. This means fixes and improvements get pushed out quicker. If a feature is ready now, then deploy it! Debugging is easier because less code has been modified. And reverting “bad” changes is much simpler and less impactful.</p>
<p>A complete digital transformation (that modernizes your infrastructure, your business platforms, and your applications) can completely revolutionize the way you do business.</p>
<h1 id="Cost-of-Modernization"><a href="#Cost-of-Modernization" class="headerlink" title="Cost of Modernization"></a>Cost of Modernization</h1><p>Every change comes with a cost. And digital transformation is no different. Moving your business platforms and applications over to new infrastructure will take some time and effort. Before you take this step, you will probably want to do a basic cost-benefit analysis. However, because the cloud works so differently, a straightforward comparison can be tricky. Shifting to the cloud means moving away from capital expenditures and moving towards more operational expenditures. </p>
<p>For someone used to traditional budgeting, this can actually make things easier once you get used to it. You no longer need to make a bunch of expensive purchases upfront. You can start out small and add more later when needed. You just have to pay for what you use. Once you get used to the idea, it’s really quite freeing.</p>
<p>Normally, a new department will have to spend a significant amount of resources to build up their technology and expertise. Large companies traditionally have had a huge advantage over their smaller competitors. However, cloud resources means that even the smallest organization can use the same tools and tech as everyone else. You don’t need to sink millions of dollars and years of time to level the playing field.</p>
<p>Now, getting back to price differences, you need to make sure you are not comparing “apples to oranges”. That’s why when you compare traditional on-premises hosting to the cloud, it is important to consider the TCO (or total cost of ownership). The TCO factors in all costs: including setup, maintenance, upgrades, and security. </p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Let’s say you are starting a brand new project and you need some servers for a website. You need to choose between purchasing physical machines or provisioning some VMs on Google Cloud Platform. A very common mistake would be to compare the Google Pricing Estimate for the VMs to a purchase order cost of the equivalent server hardware. This is a mistake, because it completely ignores a lot of extra “hidden costs”. </p>
<p>Server rooms are expensive. You need to think about the cost of space. You need to consider about how much power, and cooling will be required. What about physical security? What about all the networking gear you will need to connect everything? And don’t forget about redundancy. If something breaks you need some spares lying around so you can quickly fix the issue. In fact, you might need a whole spare data center in case your first one has problems. On top of this, you are going to have to hire a team of people to actually assemble and maintain everything. Basically, you are on the hook for every single detail.</p>
<p>And this is just the initial setup. You have to consider long-term effects as well. What if you need to rapidly grow in the future? Can you add enough hardware and hire enough employees in time? What if you need to expand into new markets? Do you have the expertise required to build a data center in another country? A decision that makes sense today, might not make as much sense tomorrow. You need to consider every angle. Do you want to focus your time and money on building and maintaining infrastructure? Or do you want to instead focus on your core products?</p>
<p>Now, this shift away from capital expenditures towards operational expenditures does require organizational change. You can’t just transform your server room. You also need to transform your processes. You need to establish a balance between spending and value. </p>
<p>The cloud allows you to try new things out for cheap. But who gets to decide what to try? And who gets to define what success looks like? You do not want to simply leave these decisions up to a single person or department. If you leave everything up to accounting, they might deny new ventures that could grow your business. If you leave it up to engineering, they spend too much on trying new things while ignoring the rate of return. Ideally, you need to establish a partnership between your finance, technology, and business teams. All three should work together to identify potential avenues for improvement, define the criteria for success, and to evaluate which initiatives are working.</p>
<p>This is facilitated with careful tracking. With the cloud, it is easier to monitor and analyze everything going on. You can track trends over a long period of time, and then perform an investigation to determine what your next move should be. For every change, your team needs to look at how things were before, and how things performed afterwards. If the success criteria was met, then you can continue moving forward and more money can be allocated. If the criteria was not met, then you can immediately suspend the project and reallocate those resources to something else.</p>
<p>This collaboration will keep everyone accountable and will ensure there is plenty of visibility into all decisions. Any mistakes can be quickly corrected and future attempts at growth will become a lot less risky. Google also provides a number of tools that will provide detailed and accurate reports for your current costs. You can monitor your current trends and set up alerts when spending starts to get out of control. You can even predict what future bills might look like. You need to understand what is happening today, in order to make the right decisions for tomorrow.</p>
<p>When comparing the old way versus the new way, make sure you have all the information at hand. What are you actually spending now? Does that number include everything? Hardware? Software? Utilities? Security? Backups? Personnel? Does the new way offer more features and flexibility? What can you not do now that you could do in the future? Make sure you have a complete and accurate picture so that you can make the right decisions.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations, you made it through the course! Let’s quickly review everything that was covered.</p>
<p>First, I talked about the need for digital transformation. Today’s customers often have higher expectations than your legacy infrastructure can deliver. In order to stay competitive, you need the speed, scale, and flexibility that GCP offers.</p>
<p>Next, I discussed the benefits of modernization. I talked about the importance of upgrading your infrastructure, your business platforms, and your applications. You also learned about some of the new options that become available such as automation and gaining new insight.</p>
<p>And finally, I covered the costs and changes required to modernize. You will need to change some of your expectations about budgeting and planning. Your best bet is to establish a partnership between finance, technology, and business teams. That way, you can evaluate business decisions in real-time and respond quickly and appropriately to any changes in the market. </p>
<p>Well, that’s all I have for you today. Remember to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching, and make sure to check out our many other courses on Cloud Academy!</p>

<h1 id="Cloud-Fundamentals-Introduction"><a href="#Cloud-Fundamentals-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Fundamentals - Introduction"></a>Cloud Fundamentals - Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to Cloud Fundamentals. My name is Daniel Mease, and I’ll be taking you through this course. I’m a trainer at Cloud Academy with over 20 years of software and web development experience. This course is intended for anyone that wants to learn about cloud computing. Now this includes people who might be seeking a career move, or just looking to grow their business.</p>
<p>After completing this course, you will be able to answer the following questions. Number one, what is the Cloud? Number two, are there different types? Number three, what are some of the key characteristics of the Cloud? And number four, what are the main Cloud services?</p>
<p>The following prerequisites will be helpful for this course. You should have a basic understanding about computers, servers, and data centers. Feedback on our courses is valuable, both to us as trainers and our future students. If you have any criticisms or suggestions for improvement, we would greatly appreciate if you would share those with us.</p>

This will allow us to make all necessary fixes to the course during its next release cycle.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Computing"></a>Cloud Computing</h1><p>So, exactly what is this “Cloud” thing that you keep hearing about? When people talk about the Cloud, they’re usually referring to Cloud computing. Cloud computing has been used heavily within the IT industry for many years now. More recently, it’s expanded into other sectors, such as retail and finance. As it becomes more and more popular, the technology is often simply referred to as “the Cloud.”</p>
<p>So if the Cloud means Cloud computing, then what is Cloud computing? Put simply, Cloud computing is a remote, virtual pool of on-demand, shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. Now, maybe that explanation makes sense to you, maybe it doesn’t. There might be a couple of terms that you’re not familiar with. Don’t worry. I’m going to break these down over the next couple of slides, after which, I’ll give you the definition again. And the next time, it should make more sense.</p>
<p>Before you can understand what Cloud computing is, you need to be aware of the technology that it’s based upon, that being virtualization. Virtualization has been used in on-premises data centers for a long time, and without virtualization, Cloud computing would not be possible. So then you ask, what is virtualization? Well, in essence, it allows you to create multiple virtual machines, or VMs, all of which run on a single server. Each of these VMs has its own operating system and set of applications. VMs can all run at the same time, completely independently, without being aware of each other’s existence. Yet, they all still share the same underlying hardware.</p>
<p>This sharing of resources is a key element of understanding virtualization, and it’s achieved through something called a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a piece of software used to create the virtualized environment. It sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines, and it creates a shared pool of virtual hardware resources for each of them to access. Any request from a VM to the hardware passes through the hypervisor, thus ensuring that the hardware resources are properly shared as needed.</p>
<p>Now, virtual machines can be called different things. Sometimes you’ll hear the term “instance,” or sometimes you’ll hear even “server.” These terms are vendor specific, but they can both mean the same thing as a virtual machine.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of virtualization, but here are the main ones. Number one, easily share resources. Virtualization makes it much easier for many different people to share the same hardware. You can have someone running Windows, and someone else running Linux, both at the same time and on the same number computer. Number two, less waste. Most computers are not constantly running at 100% utilization. Right now, your computer is probably only using a small fraction of its CPU and memory to play this video. Virtualization gives you access to previously unused resources. And so, it reduces the total number of computers needed. Number three, lower operating costs. With virtualization, you have less computers sitting idle. And less hardware means less space, power, and cooling that are required. Number four, more environmentally friendly. Less hardware that needs to be manufactured and less power consumed means virtualization also helps promote green computing, as well.</p>
<p>So these virtual machines can be used to build and share different types of resources, including compute, storage, database, and network. Now there are other types, as well, but we’ll stick to the main four for this course.</p>
<p>Compute resources provide on-demand processing power to complete your workloads. Whenever you have a program or a script that needs to run, compute resources can run for you. In your traditional on-premises data centers, these would be the equivalent to the physical servers that you could connect to remotely, and install, and run software on.</p>
<p>Storage resources allow you to save and retrieve your unstructured data. Any resource that allows you to store things like images or video in the Cloud is classified as a storage resource. In a traditional data center, you would have DAS, or directly attached storage, which includes hard and solid state drives. You might also have had things like NAS, or SAN, network attached storage, or storage area network.</p>
<p>Database resources allow you to store structured sets of data for use in your applications. So the equivalent here in your traditional data center would include databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL. And network resources, which allow you to control how all the other resources will communicate with each other. Now, in a traditional data center, this would include things such as routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers. In Cloud computing, these resources can either be directly managed by the end-user, or management can be abstracted away to create serverless offerings. Serverless does not mean that there are literally no servers or VMs. It just means that the VMs are hidden. Serverless offerings don’t require any knowledge or interaction with the underlying virtual machines. Instead, you can use a serverless service, and it will silently manage the VMs for you. So, for example, in a serverless database, whenever you need more storage or processing power, it’s automatically added in the background. Then, when less processing power is required, resources can be automatically removed. So you can use a serverless database without having to worry about upgrades, updates, or maintenance.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our definition of Cloud computing and see if it makes more sense. Cloud computing is a remote, virtual pool of on-demand, shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. So, a Cloud vendor has a number of physical computers in multiple data centers, and they’re divided up into virtual machines. Now, these virtual machines are used to build compute, storage, database, network, and many other types of services. With Cloud computing, you have the ability to request and use as many of these virtual resources as needed. When you need to scale things up to meet a sharp increase in demand, you can do so.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Types"><a href="#Cloud-Types" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Types"></a>Cloud Types</h1><p>Even though people talk about the cloud as if it were a single thing, there are actually different types. There are public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. Now, each offers a different level of management, flexibility, security, and resilience.</p>
<p>Let’s start by talking about public clouds. A public cloud is a collection of virtual on-demand services that are offered to the public. The vendor essentially rents out use of its hardware to many different customers. Each customer can use what they want when they need it. Today, you might only need five web servers, but tomorrow you might need 500. The major cloud vendors are capable of providing more resources than you could possibly use. These resources are typically accessible from anywhere, as long as you have a working internet connection. All back-end maintenance, including power, cooling, upgrades, and repairs are handled by the cloud vendor. The customer will never actually see the hardware, nor will they know the exact physical location of their services or data. They’ll usually be able to specify the geographic region in which it resides. This allows them to have some control for data storage requirements, and for latency.</p>
<p>A private cloud is similar to a public cloud, but the main difference is that the resources are not shared to the general public. Typically, a company will create its own private cloud and share the resources among its various departments. Everything is hosted, managed, and owned by that company. This allows for direct control over the resources. Enterprises who wish to keep a tighter grasp on security might adopt this architecture. Now, maybe this sounds exactly like the on-premises data center approach, but the difference is that the private cloud uses the same cloud principles as the public. Different teams and different departments are provided on-demand access to the same pool of shared scalable resources. That means you no longer have certain machines dedicated to finance or human resources. Everyone shares the same resources. Accounting can use some VMs to crunch some numbers for a while, and then afterwards, marketing can use those same VMs to render a new video. Resources are shifted around as needed.</p>
<p>With this approach, the company has more control, but it also has a lot more responsibility. Private clouds require a lot of initial capital to purchase the hardware and to set up the data centers. Not only this, but additional resources will be needed to maintain everything. Now, individual departments will have more flexibility, but the company as a whole can’t use more resources than it currently physically owns. Plus, any unused resources still have costs associated with them.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud is literally the combination of public and private clouds. That is, you’ll have some dedicated resources in a private cloud for predictable workloads, but when you use up all available resources, you can always request more from a public cloud. Now the hybrid model is built by establishing a network link between your private cloud and a public cloud. Thus, you essentially extend the internal network of your private cloud. Now, in theory, this gives you the benefits of both models, so you can choose where each service most appropriately fits. However, in practice, the hybrid model tends to suffer from the negatives of both solutions. And because of this, hybrid clouds are typically short-term configurations. They often represent a transitional state for enterprises. It’s usually more of a way to bridge the transition from on-premises to a public cloud model.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Concepts"><a href="#Cloud-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Concepts"></a>Cloud Concepts</h1><p>Cloud computing has a number of key characteristics that allows it to become the powerful service that it is today. Let’s go through the main ones.</p>
<p>On-demand resourcing. This essentially means that when you want to provision a resource within the cloud, it’s almost immediately available to you. You allocate them when and where you need them. There’s no more waiting around for hardware to be ordered, installed, cabled, and configured before you can use it. It’s often as simple as filling out a form and clicking submit.</p>
<p>Consumption-based. With many cloud services, you only pay for what you use. What do I mean by this? Well, if you only have a server running for two hours and then you shut it down, then you’re only going to pay for two hours worth of compute resources. It’s just like your power bill at home and how you only pay for the electricity you use.</p>
<p>Scalability and agility. Cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment’s resources, both up and down and in and out. It depends upon the requirements and the demands of your application and services. When scaling up and down, you’re altering the power and performance of a particular instance. Perhaps you’re using one with greater CPU or memory power. When scaling in and out, you’re simply adding or removing instances to your fleet of compute resources. This gives you the ultimate flexibility to keep up with the ever-changing demands of the market. And it frees you up to try new things and experiment with much lower initial costs.</p>
<p>Economy of scale. Public cloud vendors can procure hardware for much cheaper due to bulk pricing. Also, it’s simply more economical to create and run large public cloud data centers rather than having each company with its own on premises. You, as the end user can benefit from these exceptionally low resource costs compared to traditional hosting.</p>
<p>Highly available. By design, many of the core services on the public cloud are replicated across different geographic zones and regions. That means that a disruption in one area does not have to result in any downtime. When one zone goes down, you can usually seamlessly switch to another. In this way, you can ensure the durability of your data and the availability of your services.</p>
<p>Flexibility and elasticity. Cloud computing offers huge flexibility and elasticity to your design approach. You can choose to have as many or as few resources as you require. You decide how much and how long you want it for, and at what scale. You have full control and can make fairly significant changes without worrying about waste.</p>
<p>Shared infrastructure. As discussed previously, multiple instances running on the same hardware significantly reduces the amount of physical hardware required. This in turn reduces the amount of power, cooling, and space required. All this results in cheaper costs for you, the customer.</p>
<p>Security. Now, this is one of the most discussed topics within cloud computing and many enterprises still have concerns. However, the major public cloud vendors are considered to be more secure than your own data center. The main vendors operate at an exceptionally high standard of security. They manage the security of the cloud by securing the data centers. And it’s up to you to ensure security in the cloud by correctly leveraging the tools, services, and applications available. If you copy your private information to a publicly accessible website, that’s on you. These are just some of the key characteristics of cloud computing. There are more, but these are typically the most important.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Service-Models"><a href="#Cloud-Service-Models" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Service Models"></a>Cloud Service Models</h1><p>There are many different types of services available in the cloud. These services can typically be grouped into a few different models. I’m now going to talk about the three most common, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. You’ve probably used many examples of software as a service, or SaaS, without even realizing it. SaaS offerings are ready to use applications. There’s nothing to install or maintain. Users can simply access the application over the internet. Probably one of the most well-known examples of this would be Google Gmail. Any user can sign in and access their email over the internet. You don’t have to install anything. As long as you can bring up a browser, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>SaaS offerings require little to no setup, but usually offer the least amount of customization. Platform as a service offers a greater level of control, but it requires more setup. Essentially, you’re given access to a certain environment and you can build or run whatever you want on it. The underlying architecture, the hardware operating system, and maybe even things like libraries, those are all managed by the cloud vendor. Basically this gives developers a simple platform to deploy and run code on. They can concentrate on writing software and they don’t have to waste a lot of time maintaining, upgrading and patching servers.</p>
<p>The highest level of customization offered is on infrastructure as a service. Now these services give you the option of architecting your own virtual data center. You can start out by configuring a virtual network with routers, firewalls and private IP address ranges. Then you can configure different virtual machine instances. You pick the operating system at the libraries, install any applications. It feels a lot closer to your traditional on premises data center. Now, this service does offer the highest level of customization and control, however, the underlying hardware is still managed by the vendor. So you’re not going to have complete control and there are going to be some limits on what you can and cannot change. Now, these aren’t the only service models available. You have other ones like disaster recovery as a service communications as a service and monitoring as a service. For the purposes of this course, we’re not going to go that deep. However, you should be aware that more and more of these services are popping up all over the industry.</p>
<h1 id="Common-Use-Cases-of-Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Common-Use-Cases-of-Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Common Use Cases of Cloud Computing"></a>Common Use Cases of Cloud Computing</h1><p>It’s great to understand the technical details of how cloud computing works. But in this section, I wanna provide you with some practical-use cases so that you understand how people typically use the cloud. Startups. One of the difficulties in creating a new startup company is the initial amount of work and overhead that are required. Technology-wise, you might have to build an entire IT department from scratch. You also probably need things like servers, networking, licenses, and a team to build everything out and keep it running. And, because a startup’s needs can radically change, purchasing a bunch of equipment and hiring employees that might not be needed tomorrow can be too risky. What if your customer base increases 100 times overnight? Will your company be able to keep up? In cases like these, partnering with a cloud vendor is a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Proof of concept. Similarly, the cloud is a great fit for research and development. If you need to build a proof of concept, the cloud can let you create it at a fraction of the cost. You don’t need a huge initial investment of capital. Access whatever resources you need and then evaluate. Is your prototype going to work? Will it be successful? Is it going to bring in enough revenue to justify its cost? You can use the results of your proof of concept to better predict success or failure before committing too many resources.</p>
<p>Traffic Bursting. A very common scenario for companies is to have periods of time where extra computing resources are required. Perhaps you’re in the retail business and the Christmas season brings with it additional shoppers and orders. In a classic data center environment, to handle the extra load, you would need to have extra hardware on hand that would mostly sit idle the rest of the year. A far better way to handle this would be to leverage on-demand resources from a public cloud. The major cloud vendors can scale to handle almost any load imaginable.</p>
<p>Backup and Disaster Recovery. Due to the public cloud’s built-in resiliency and durability, it makes for a great backup solution. If something like an earthquake or hurricane strikes the same area your systems are running, then you can simply move them to another location. With the cloud, you have access to virtually unlimited storage space. All of your data can have multiple copies, and those copies can be stored across many different locations. Physically relocating a new data center can take weeks, months, or even years. Moving around in the cloud might only take you a few minutes, depending upon your setup. It also can be significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>Cold or infrequently accessed storage costs much less than warm storage that holds frequently used data. So you can archive your backups for practically pennies. In the cloud, keeping detailed backups of everything is actually viable.</p>
<p>Websites and other Web-based Services. Many organizations choose to host their web services in the cloud due to its ability to rapidly scale up and down with demand. In addition, the wide geographic distribution of data centers, gives you the ability to place servers close to your users. It also allows you to access certain services like Content Delivery Networks, or CDNs. A CDN is a set of systems that redirects traffic to a nearby caching server. As a result, this can significantly reduce a website’s latency for its users across the globe.</p>
<p>Testing and Development Environments. Many companies do not have the extra resources available for proper testing and development. Financially speaking, they can just be too costly. Using the public cloud allows you to spin up servers for a short time and then shut them down when you’re finished. So if you need to occasionally build and test one of your products, you don’t need a set of dedicated machines.</p>
<p>Big Data. The cloud also makes it easier and cheaper to manage massive amounts of data, or big data. Building and maintaining specialized resources to handle huge data sets can be expensive and complicated. By using the cloud, you have access to specialized resources to make your analysis quicker and easier. Having some of these elements managed by a cloud vendor allows you to focus on the data and not worry about the underlying architecture.</p>
<p>Now, this was just a few examples, and there are many other use cases as well. At this point, you probably have a few ideas of your own.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-vs-On-Premises"><a href="#Cloud-vs-On-Premises" class="headerlink" title="Cloud vs On-Premises"></a>Cloud vs On-Premises</h1><p>In this section, I wanna talk about the main differences between the public cloud and traditional, on-premises data centers. You may be new to cloud computing, but I am going to assume that you already understand how on-premises data centers operate. I’m going to make several comparisons between it and cloud computing. When building and running your own data center, you have a quite the list of responsibilities. You need to worry about things like picking the right a location. You have to decide where it’s going to be physically located. You have to factor in things like the cost of land and property taxes. You need to make sure that you can access reliable power, reliable internet connection, and you need to make sure that you’re gonna have enough room for growth in the future.</p>
<p>Next, you’re gonna have to think about things like physical Security. This includes both external and internal. So you might have to hire a security team. You’re gonna have to install a bunch of locks and cameras and set some alarms. You need to consider things like mechanical and electrical infrastructure. That means you gotta think about things like air conditioning, setting up backup generators and UPS units, and you have to think about things like fire suppression.</p>
<p>Of course, those elements are just part of the building itself. You’re also gonna have to fill it with a bunch of hardware. So you’re gonna need a bunch of network infrastructure. That means things like switches, routers, and firewalls. You’re gonna need the physical machines and servers. This includes both hardware and software. And you’re gonna need lots and lots of storage. This includes hard drives, solid state drives, and things like NAS and SAN.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at each of these again, but this time from the perspective of using the cloud. Location. So depending on the size of your company, you might only have one or two data center locations. However, public cloud providers have locations all over the globe. And within each of these regions, they’re gonna have at least two data centers. Now, these data centers are kept separate so that if one goes down, the other is gonna be still be up and running. But they’re located close enough to each other to ensure high speed interconnectivity.</p>
<p>Physical security. As we’ve already discovered, the public cloud is operated, managed and maintained by the vendor. As a result, the end user has no access to the physical data center where the resources are located. It’s completely the vendor’s responsibility to ensure the correct certification and governance regarding security. Public cloud vendors adhere to the most stringent of controls, and for auditing purposes, you can access their compliance certifications online. Mechanical and electrical Infrastructure. Now, mechanical and electrical infrastructure, such as generators, are all situated at the data center itself. So as a result, the same rule applies. This is the vendor’s responsibility. So again, this burden is removed from the end user.</p>
<p>Network infrastructure. In the public cloud, you no longer have direct access to the network hardware. There’s no longer any way for you to physically install a switch or a router. The cloud vendor is responsible for setting that all up and maintaining that. All physical networking components have been replaced with virtual components. So in order for you to use this, you typically start by creating a virtual network. These virtual networks work pretty similarly to physical networks. You can segment them into different IP address ranges. You can set the different network segments to be either public facing or private. Routing and access control lists can also be configured for enhanced control. And once you have completed your virtual network, you can then provision your resources within these subnets.</p>
<p>Servers. Depending on your vendor, virtual machines are typically referred to as “instances.” But just as there are different types of physical servers, vendors offer different types of instances. For example, most providers offer instances that are optimized for running databases. Now, this is part of the benefit of the cloud. The vendors are capable of replicating the same functions that you use today, but usually with a lot more optimization and polish.</p>
<p>Storage. Now, storage is fantastic within the cloud. It’s essentially unlimited, it’s hugely scalable, and it’s highly durable. And as with compute, there are many different storage services, depending on what you need. These include both block-level and object-level storage. So, as you can see, the on-premises data center involves a lot more responsibilities, as well as a number of extra costs. Building your own data center requires significant upfront capital that often needs to be depreciated over a number of years. To help explain this, let me go a little deeper. So there are two main types of expenses in an organization. You have capital expenditures, or CapEx, and operating expenditures, or OpEx. Capital expenditures are major purchases that your company makes over the long-term. Operating expenses are the day-to-day expenses. So purchasing a company car would be a capital expense. Renting a car would be an operating expense. Capital expenditures generally can be a great way to save money when your needs are predictable. But unfortunately, business needs are rarely predictable. Will that new database server you just bought today work as well in two years? How many software licenses are you actually gonna be using six months from now? By leveraging the cloud, you can exchange your capital expenditures for operating expenditures. This “consumption-based model” can give your business the agility it needs to stay competitive in an ever-changing market. I have only skimmed the surface of the available services within the public cloud. Certain vendors will offer much, much more. However, I just wanted to point out how migrating your existing systems to a public cloud can bring significant benefits.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Fundamentals-Summary"><a href="#Cloud-Fundamentals-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Fundamentals - Summary"></a>Cloud Fundamentals - Summary</h1><p>Before we end, I wanna review some of the main points that we covered. First. What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. These resources include things like compute, storage, database, and networking services. What are the three types of clouds? We talked about public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. A public cloud is accessible by the public. A private cloud is kept private and only the people within a company can access that private cloud. And the hybrid cloud is a combination of the two. So you’ll have a private cloud that you use for some things, and for other things, you’ll use a public cloud. To help you understand the differences, I’ve created this simple table.</p>
<p>So, we can see here, for security, in the public cloud this is a shared responsibility model. The vendor manages the security of the infrastructure and the company is responsible for securing the software and services. Now in a private cloud, the security is the sole responsibility of the company. And of course, the hybrid is a combination of the two. It depends on where your services are. Some services will be in the public cloud, and those will have the shared responsibility model. Services running in the private cloud will be the sole responsibility of the company.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to data location, in a public cloud, the company gets to specify an area, but never quite knows the exact physical location. With a private cloud, the company has full control and knowledge about the location of their data and services. And the hybrid cloud has a combination. Again, it depends on if your services and data are running in the private cloud or the public cloud.</p>
<p>Now, for capital expenditures, there’s absolutely none in the public cloud. You don’t have any upfront costs. With the private cloud, it’s the exact opposite. Your capital expenditure will be very high. Everything needs to be paid for and built upfront. Now, with the hybrid, it’s somewhere in between. It really depends upon the size of your private cloud. For operational expenditures, this is gonna be variable in the public cloud. As you use more resources, your costs are gonna go up. As you use less, it’s gonna go down.</p>
<p>Now, in the private cloud, this is also going to be high, because you’ve had to pay for all your resources, whether you use them or not. Sure, you might save a little bit on electricity when a server’s sitting there idle, but you already paid for the hardware and you’re paying for the team to maintain it and monitor it. In the hybrid model, again, this is gonna be mixed. It’s gonna depend upon the size of your private cloud. For tenancy, in the public cloud, resources are typically shared between multiple companies. So, maybe you and a major competitor are actually using different parts of the same server.</p>
<p>Now, in some public clouds, there’s certain resources that can be dedicated to a specific company if needed for regulation purposes. In a private cloud, you don’t have to worry about this at all. There’s only ever a single tenant for every resource. And again, in the hybrid model, it’s a combination of the two.</p>
<p>All right, next, what were the three main cloud service models? Well, we talked about software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service. Now, in software as a service, remember, everything’s handled for you. It’s essentially on demand software. In platform as a service, you’re provided a pre-configured environment and you can use that to install and run software. So, you’re responsible for the application that’s ran, but everything else is taken care of for you by the vendor. In infrastructure as a service, you have a lot more freedom, but more responsibilities. The physical machines and the core infrastructure is taken care of for you, but you’re responsible for provisioning, installing and configuring everything else.</p>
<p>I hope you now have a good understanding of what cloud computing is, as well as how it can be used to create secure, reliable, and scalable systems. Well, that’s all I have for you today.

<h1 id="Additional-Topics"><a href="#Additional-Topics" class="headerlink" title="Additional Topics"></a>Additional Topics</h1><p>Congratulations on making it all the way through this learning path. There are a few topics that you’ll need to know for the exam that weren’t covered yet, so I’ll go over them now.</p>
<p>First up is Azure Container Instances. Although Kubernetes is usually the preferred system for running container-based applications, it would be overkill if you just need to run one container. For example, suppose you want to deploy a simple web application that’s in a single Docker container. Using Azure Container Instances, you can deploy it very easily.</p>
<p>All you have to do is run the <code>az container create</code> command and specify the resource group, the name you want to give the container, the image it should use to build the container, the DNS name to assign to its public IP address, and the ports you want to open. This single command will spin up your container. I should point out that the name parameter is technically for the name of the container <em>group</em> because it’s possible to spin up more than one container at the same time, but in most cases, you’ll probably use this command to spin up only a single container.</p>
<p>If you want to check the status of your container, you can use the <code>az container show</code> command. This will give you lots of details about your container, such as its IP address, its operating system, and its current state.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create and manage Azure Container Instances using PowerShell or the Azure Portal.</p>
<p>The next topic is a feature of Azure Functions called Durable Functions. Typically Azure functions are stateless, meaning when a function runs, it doesn’t know anything about previous runs of that function. A classic example of an Azure function is one that waits for an image file to be uploaded to a particular container in Blob storage and then creates a thumbnail version of that image. It’s stateless because it doesn’t matter what images it processed in the past, it runs in exactly the same way every time. Furthermore, it doesn’t care what other Azure functions are doing either. It only cares about its own job.</p>
<p>This approach is fine for simple applications, but if you try to build a more complex application out of stateless functions, you’ll probably have to write a lot of code to try to coordinate the actions of these functions.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you’re writing an order processing system that needs to execute four different functions in the same sequence every time. To make that happen, you’d have to write code to ensure that the output of the first function triggers the execution of the second function, and so on. It is possible to do this by creating events, but it’s much easier to use the Durable Functions library. Here’s what the C# code for this would look like.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[FunctionName(&quot;ProcessOrder&quot;)]</span><br><span class="line">public static async Task &lt; object &gt; Run([OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">	try &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		var x = await context.CallActivityAsync &lt; object &gt; (&quot;Function1&quot;, null);</span><br><span class="line">		var y = await context.CallActivityAsync &lt; object &gt; (&quot;Function2&quot;, x);</span><br><span class="line">		var z = await context.CallActivityAsync &lt; object &gt; (&quot;Function3&quot;, y);</span><br><span class="line">		return await context.CallActivityAsync &lt; object &gt; (&quot;Function4&quot;, z);</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	catch(Exception) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		// Error handling or compensation goes here.</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here are the four functions. You just need to put them in the order you want. Also notice the error handing section down here. This is another reason why it’s way easier to orchestrate a workflow using Durable Functions than to try to do it yourself. Here, your error handling code can deal with multiple components in the workflow, which would be very difficult to do with stateless functions.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the simplest use cases for Durable Functions. A more complicated example is called fan-out &#x2F; fan-in. The first function splits the work into multiple tasks that will be executed in parallel by the second function. Then the output from these parallel tasks needs to be aggregated and sent to the third function. This is much more challenging than the previous example because the third function needs to know when all of the parallel functions have completed. Using the Durable Functions extension, the code for this is still relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>The next topic is how to implement web tests using Application Insights. Once you’ve deployed a web application, you’ll want to monitor its availability so you’ll know if it ever goes down. Application Insights provides a great tool to do that.</p>
<p>Go to Application Insights, and then select Availability from the menu. Now click Add Test. The only parameters you have to set are the name of the test and the URL of the website. But there are lots of options.</p>
<p>The default test type is a URL ping test, but you can configure a multi-step web test if you want. This is a recording of a series of requests to send to your website. To create it, you have to use Visual Studio Enterprise.</p>
<p>Parse dependent requests means request all of the images, scripts, and other files in the web page instead of just the one file at the URL you specified.</p>
<p>When this is checked, the test won’t fail until it has tried to connect three times with a 20-second delay between retries. You can also change how often the test is run.</p>
<p>Here, you can set which locations to test from. Microsoft recommends testing from at least five locations.</p>
<p>When you’ve set all of the options, click the Create button. Here’s the web test.</p>
<p>There’s one more step that’s really important. You need to tell it where to send alerts when there’s a problem with the website. But it’s not obvious where to do that. In the context menu for the web test, select Edit alert. Under Action Groups, click Create. Give the action group a name. Then you have to give it a short name that’s a maximum of 12 characters.</p>
<p>You can put it in an existing resource group or just leave it so it’ll create this default resource group. Give the action a name. Under Action type, select Email&#x2F;SMS&#x2F;Push&#x2F;Voice (or one of the other options if you want to send the alerts somewhere else). I’ll tell it to send an email to this address. Click OK, and click OK again. Now click Save.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to set up a web test using an ARM template. Here’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-create-templates#template-for-an-availability-test-along-with-a-metric-alert">link</a> to an example of how to do that. OK, that’s it for additional topics for the AZ-204 exam. Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks and good luck on the exam!</p>
