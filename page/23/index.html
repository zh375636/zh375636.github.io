<h1 id="Introduction-to-Linux"><a href="#Introduction-to-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Linux"></a>Introduction to Linux</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to Cloud Academy’s series preparing you for the LPIC-1 Linux Server Professional Certification Exams and for system administration in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. My name is David Clinton, and I am going to draw on my experience in cloud computing, as a classroom teacher and as a Linux system administrator to guide you through the sometimes complicated but always rewarding path to Linux Certification. This is all about connections. The LPIC Certification is an excellent introduction to the real world of system administration. And Linux administration skills, besides their other benefits, can make you a much better cloud platform manager. I hope our connection through this series and throughout your experience with Cloud Academy will be a productive and happy one.</p>
<h3 id><a href="#" class="headerlink" title></a></h3><h3 id="Linux-History-who-invented-it-and-why-it-has-been-widely-adopted"><a href="#Linux-History-who-invented-it-and-why-it-has-been-widely-adopted" class="headerlink" title="Linux History: who invented it and why it has been widely adopted"></a><strong>Linux History: who invented it and why it has been widely adopted</strong></h3><p>The Linux history begins in late in 1991 when Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free and open-source software. Since then, while many thousands of developers have contributed significant improvements to the operating system, Torvalds, partly sponsored by the Linux Foundation, still acts as project coordinator. Considering the size and complexity of the project, and the strong, and shall we say independent personalities of many of its most creative contributors, the fact that they’ve somehow managed not only to hold the huge, massively distributed project together, but to mold it into an incredibly productive process is remarkable. Whether you choose to think of it as a community self- help project with a major catalyst driving world-scale economies, you probably won’t find too many historical projects whose impact has been comparable. To say that Linux has been widely adopted is to deeply understate the matter. While it’s probably used on less than 2% of desktop computers, <strong>Linux absolutely dominates all other computing markets</strong> including servers, mainframes, supercomputers, embedded systems, gaming consoles, network routers, and through Android smartphones. In fact, when it comes to the digitally-connected world, that thing all the kids are calling “The Internet,” the vast majority is run on Linux servers. You might be surprised at the kind of enterprises that have adopted Linux, both for their internal and public-facing infrastructure. The US Federal Aviation Authority, for instance, claims to have saved themselves $15 million through their transition to Linux.</p>
<p>Governments like those of Mexico City and Munich, despite some widely reported temporary hiccups, have successfully made the switch and so has the US Navy nuclear submarine fleet among other branches of the military. Most of the world’s best-known technology companies have chosen Linux for their computing needs including Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon.</p>
<p>In the case of Amazon, not only does the company use Linux for its own use, but the vast majority of virtual instances launched by Amazon’s AWS customers use Linux as well. Not only does Google strongly encourage its own employees to use Linux on their own desktops wherever possible, but their vast infrastructure is solidly built on the free operating system. A year ago, it was widely reported that Google launches over two billion virtual containers running Linux each week. This, by the way, illustrates how easily Linux can be scaled up or out to efficiently meet the demands of just about any project. This scalability is not only the main reason Linux is such a good match with the cloud-computing paradigm, but probably the main reason cloud computing exists in the first place. With everything from traffic lights and air traffic control, to Internet commerce all hanging on Linux systems, there’s obviously a huge and growing demand for people with Linux skills - a demand that won’t be slowing anytime soon. Users and users standing behind the Linux project have historically contributed to a far more secure and reliable platform.</p>
<p>Interestingly as part of a white paper I once wrote, I discovered that online support requests for help using the open-source LibreOffice and OpenOffice product suites would generally receive replies within five hours. At the time, Microsoft promised a response time of one hour for critical, and next business day for high-need issues for their Office 365 Help Request for subscribers to their Small Business Premium Servers. The difference of course was that Microsoft’s service cost $13.25 per month per user while the high-quality LibreOffice and OpenOffice support was and still is absolutely free. Perhaps most of all, Linux is versatile. Welcome to the world of specialized distros.</p>
<p>Besides the well-known major distributions like Ubuntu, Debian and Red Hat, there’s a purpose-built version for just about any niche purpose you can imagine. Looking to build a really cheap firewall appliance? Try IPCop. Want a customized router? OpenWrt is what you’re after. Do you need secure digital forensics? Try Kali Linux.</p>
<p>Digital entertainment servers? Mythbuntu. Music production work station? Ubuntu Studio. While Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercially supported distribution aimed at high-end enterprise deployments, you might prefer the same core software but without the cost of commercial support. Fedora or CentOS might fill that need. Don’t like the new System-D Resource Management Suite? Feel free to use one of the many distros still running within it instead. Do you need an OS that will provide serious competition in choice in the smartphone market? Google’s Android mobile operating system is built right on top of the Linux kernel. Even the way you interact with your software resources can be highly personalized by selecting from the rich range of desktop interfaces. Not all of these popular examples are natively available for every single distribution, but you’re bound to find some combination of aesthetics, convenience and workflow model that works for you.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction-to-the-LPIC-and-AWS"><a href="#Introduction-to-the-LPIC-and-AWS" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to the LPIC and AWS"></a>Introduction to the LPIC and AWS</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic-1-linux-certification-introduction/introduction-to-linux/">Linux</a> is really big and its rate of growth is showing no signs of slowing. If you want to play a role in building the infrastructure that’s powering our connected world, and if you want to get paid well to do it, then you really have to master some solid Linux administration skills. </p>
<h3 id="LPI-Certification-is-it-worth-getting-a-Linux-certification"><a href="#LPI-Certification-is-it-worth-getting-a-Linux-certification" class="headerlink" title="LPI Certification: is it worth getting a Linux certification?"></a>LPI Certification: is it worth getting a Linux certification?</h3><p>From my personal experience and from the experience of many others like me, the Linux Professional Institute’s LPIC exams are an excellent place to start. The fact is that I would never have won my first job as a sysadmin without my <strong>LPI</strong> certification but it was better than that. The very process of studying for the exam itself made a huge difference. It wasn’t just because the skills I needed to pass the exam proved to be genuinely useful in the real world which they did. But because they also gave me the basic knowledge and confidence to figure out how to find solutions to new problems that came up.</p>
<p>Remember, the tech world changes so fast that no certification could claim to teach you everything. But having a good grasp of the basic tools allows you to identify and adopt new skills much faster. The LPIC does that. The Linux Professional Institute offers three certification levels, the LPIC-1, which focuses on the skills you’ll need to provision and manage servers or small deployments of PCs, requires two proctored exams. Each costing $183, the LPI 101 and the LPI 102. These series of 11 Cloud Academy courses is designed to provide you with what you’ll need to pass these two exams and receive the LPIC-1 certification, the LPIC-2 aims to test your ability to administer small to medium size mixed networks. This certification also requires two exams the LPI 201 and the LPI 202. Finally the LPIC-3 requires you to choose from among three high-end Linux enterprise architecture specialties.</p>
<p>You’ll need to take only one of the three 300 level exams they offer, mixed environments, security or virtualization and high availability. All LPI certifications are valid for five years. You can find a lot more exam background and support on the LPI website, LPI.org.</p>
<p>What does Amazon Web Services have to do with all of this? Linux is big, but if anything, the Cloud is even bigger. As consumers and enterprises demand greater and greater connectivity, and more people, devices and things expect to be able to talk to each other in real-time, managing an ever changing network of millions of virtual objects is a very big deal. Now since Linux is the operating system that’s carrying the vast majority of this weight and since Amazon AWS is the platform where right now at least most of the action is taking place, it’ll make a lot of sense to give the two some shared attention. That’s why Cloud Academy decided to create this as a blended curriculum. We’ll cover everything you’ll need to know for the LPIC exam, but wherever it makes sense, we’ll also introduce you to the AWS way of doing things. That way, you’ll hopefully get to walk away with your LPIC-1 certification and with a pretty good idea of how to apply your new skills in just the place where they’ll be in greatest demand.</p>
<h1 id="Survival-Skills-the-command-line-interface-CLI-and-Filesystems"><a href="#Survival-Skills-the-command-line-interface-CLI-and-Filesystems" class="headerlink" title="Survival Skills: the command line interface (CLI) and Filesystems"></a>Survival Skills: the command line interface (CLI) and Filesystems</h1><p>You might not yet have all that much practical experience using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic-1-linux-certification-introduction/introduction-to-linux/">Linux</a> command line interface - or the Terminal, as it’s often known - but you should definitely expect that to change as you move through this series. However, there are some basic skills that you’ll need right away and, even though we’re going to discuss all these details in later videos, it makes a lot of sense to spend a few minutes up front learning them.</p>
<h3 id="Some-basic-Linux-command-line-survival-skills"><a href="#Some-basic-Linux-command-line-survival-skills" class="headerlink" title="Some basic Linux command line survival skills"></a>Some basic Linux command line survival skills</h3><p>Just to make sure that I’m not leaving anyone out of the loop, the first thing I’m going to show you is how to access the terminal itself - you’d be surprised how many people who have been around computers for years might not know this. Once we’ve got that covered, I’ll describe the structure of the Linux file system, the dozen or so commands that you just can’t live without, and then the art of launching shell sessions under different identities.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering…here’s how you find the Linux Terminal. If you’re using the Ubuntu Unity Desktop, you could click on the Launcher at the top of the icon panel and start typing the word terminal. Since I had just used the terminal a few moments before, Launcher anticipated that I might want the terminal even before I started typing, but typing it out will definitely get the job done.</p>
<p>If you’re using a Linux Desktop with a more traditional interface, then you could either navigate through the Applications menu until you hit what you’re after, or type the Alt and F2 keys together to display the Run Application menu, into which you can then begin typing gnome-terminal (or sometimes just terminal).</p>
<p>So now everyone’s happy.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how the Linux filesystem is organized.</p>
<p>With a couple of very small exceptions, all files of all kinds on a Linux install can be found somewhere beneath the root directory. Visually, the root is often represented by a single forward slash. Below root, you’ll see top level directories, most of which contain system data or configuration files. Working with the contents of these directories usually requires administrator permissions - which we’ll discuss a bit later. The directory that should interest us the most right now, however, is slash-home, which contains all private user files. When a new user account is added to a Linux system, a directory with the same name is created beneath the &#x2F;home directory. Often, once the user logs in to the graphic desktop for the first time, a set of user directories like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Videos will be automatically created for him. The user will generally have the right to create, edit, and delete any files or subdirectories found beneath his or her personal home directory.</p>
<p>By the way, even though we call our default directory “home” it’s not the same as the slash-home directory, which is actually the <em>parent</em> directory to all the user directories. That can sometimes be a bit confusing.</p>
<p>When a user logs on to the system and opens either the Nautilus GUI file manager or a terminal session, his default working location is always going to be his home directory, and it’s there that saved files will, in most cases, end up.</p>
<p>This brings us to command line tools.</p>
<p>We’ll start by learning how to move around between directories. cd stands for Change Directory and, when followed by the name of directory, will take you there. Since we’re currently in our user’s default home directory, we’ll type cd and forward slash to move to the root directory. Type ls to list the names of all the subdirectories and files contained in this directory. To move to one of these subdirectories, type, say, cd dev. Because you didn’t include a slash in front of the directory name, the system assumes that the directory location is relative to our current location. To move to a different location, you would tell Linux that this will be an absolute location by starting with a slash. In this case, we’ll go to &#x2F;var&#x2F;log.</p>
<p>Let’s type ls to see who lives in &#x2F;var&#x2F;log. As you might have guessed, it’s mostly system log files. We’ll spend a fair amount of time working with those in later videos. But now we’ll type ls -l to see the long version of the directory listing.</p>
<p>Starting from the right, we see the names of each file - or, when they’re colored blue, of a subdirectory. To the left is the date when the file was last updated. To the left of that is the file size in bytes, the group to which the file (or directory) belongs, then the owner and, finally, the special notation that tells us what kind of access various categories of users and groups will have to the file. Believe me, every piece of the information you see here can be important. I was once able to prove that I wasn’t responsible for a bit of security breach because the date of the update in question happened to correspond to a day I was at the hospital undergoing a minor test.</p>
<p>By way of a quick review: ls will list files, while ls -l will give you a longer list including details about ownership and activity history. Referring to an address that starts with a slash will be interpreted as an absolute address based on the root directory. All other addresses will be understood to be relative to your current location.</p>
<p>At any rate, let’s see what’s inside some of these files. cat will scroll through an entire file - in this case, the btmp file. Let’s run ls -l again to see what else we can find. Let’s cat alternatives.log but, since that’s a lot to type and, like all good sysadmins, we’re lazy, we’ll just start it off, and use the tab key on the keyboard to let Command Completion finish it for us. Command Completion will read what you’ve already typed, and from context, will try to guess what you’re after. Over a long career, command completion can save you hundreds of hours and, perhaps, thousands of dollars on orthopedic surgery. Also: hitting the arrow-up key will populate the command line with previous commands that you’ve used, in reverse order.</p>
<p>Let’s move back to our home directory - which can be done using either cd &#x2F;home&#x2F;ubuntu - which is my username - or cd tilda - that’s the key at the top left corner of most keyboards. The tilda, in Linux commands, is used to represent a user’s home directory.</p>
<p>Now, the next three or four commands concern file management. Touch will create an empty file with the specified name. Let’s try touch newfile. Now we’ll use mkdir - makedirectory - to create a new directory, called, say, newdir. Typing ls shows us that we were successful, and the file newfile and directory newdir now both exist. We can copy the file to a new location using cp newfile &#x2F;home&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;newdir - which will create a copy of newfile in our new directory. We could also use cp to create a copy of the file in the current directory, but giving it a new name. Type cp newfile newerfile. Let’s hit ls again to make sure everything turned out as we planned.</p>
<p>Rather than creating copies, we might sometimes need to move files from one location (or filename) to another. Type mv newerfile oldfile. Listing the files shows us that newerfile is gone, but oldfile now exists.</p>
<p>To remove - or delete - a file altogether, use rm oldfile. To remove a directory, type rm -r (for recursive) newdir.</p>
<p>Let’s review, cat will print an entire text file to your screen, your home directory is referred to either using &#x2F;home&#x2F;yourname or tilda, touch will create an empty file, cp makes a copy of a file or directory, mv moves or renames a file or directory, and rm permanently removes a file or directory. For your command to affect subdirectories and their files, you must add -r for your action to be recursive. We also saw two very handy tips: arrow-up displays previous commands, and tab will enable command completion.</p>
<h3 id="Linux-administration-permissions"><a href="#Linux-administration-permissions" class="headerlink" title="Linux administration permissions"></a>Linux administration permissions</h3><p>You absolutely must understand how to control the way you identify yourself to the Linux system. As we’ve mentioned, by and large, you don’t have the permissions to edit system files or files belonging to other users. As a great deal of system administration requires control of these files, you will sometimes have to assume other roles. Assuming that you are part of the sudo group (and, if you’re using the account created when you installed Linux, then you probably are), you can assume admin powers for a single command by prefixing a command with the word sudo.</p>
<p>Therefore, for instance, it’s possible to create a new file in the system root directory. Let’s cd to root, and then type touch myfile. It doesn’t work. But if we add sudo, we’ll be asked for the login password for this account, and the file will be created. Ls shows us that it’s now there.</p>
<p>From a security standpoint, manually using sudo for each command where it’s necessary is by far the preferred way to go about it. However, there may be times when you’ll need to keep admin powers for a longer session. For these times, you can type sudo su, enter your password (if necessary), and every subsequent command will work with admin powers. You leave the sudo shell by typing exit. Notice how the name used as part of the command prompt changed back and forth.</p>
<p>Finally, you can adopt the identity of a different system user by using su (which stands for switch user). Since there’s a user on this system named Tony, let’s type su tony, enter Tony’s password (I sincerely hope he doesn’t mind) and, again, note how the command prompt changed. Everything we will do until we exit this shell will be done as Tony.</p>
<h1 id="LXCs-the-safest-way-to-learn-Linux-skills"><a href="#LXCs-the-safest-way-to-learn-Linux-skills" class="headerlink" title="LXCs: the safest way to learn Linux skills"></a>LXCs: the safest way to learn Linux skills</h1><p>If you want to really learn enough about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic-1-linux-certification-introduction/introduction-to-linux/">Linux</a> to have a chance at passing the LPIC exam, just watching these videos won’t be enough. You’ll also have to try everything out for yourself. Even better, you’ll have to play around with each of the tools we’ll discuss to see how they’ll work differently using different configuration parameters.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of these tools are very powerful, and if you don’t fully understand what you’re doing - or even if you make a simple typing error - you can cause yourself a great deal of grief. In fact, as we will learn, running commands as the admin user can easily cripple your whole system. Here’s a very common example: you’ve just downloaded and installed a software package and, after unpacking it into a directory and working with it for a while, you realize it’s not what you’re after. Rather than leaving old, unused packages lying around your system, you decide to remove all of the files in one shot. So that you’ll catch even the files stored in subdirectories, you make your remove command recursive using: rm -r *</p>
<p>Perfect. Except that you’ve forgotten that - since this is a new shell session that you’ve just opened - your current work directly is no longer the one into which you originally unpacked the package, but your home directory. You’ve just wiped out every single personal file on your system. And the console doesn’t dump deleted files in a GUI trash can. They’re gone.</p>
<p>Scared? You can bet that I am.</p>
<p>So you’ll need to play around a lot in order to learn. But until you learn, every command you use puts you at great risk. How is this going to end happily? Linux has a beautiful solution: Virtualization. You may already be aware that many of the web services you use are driven not by individual servers running single operating system instances, but by virtual machines launched from host servers (often called hypervisors).</p>
<h3 id="Using-Linux-LXC-virtual-machines-as-a-learning-sandbox"><a href="#Using-Linux-LXC-virtual-machines-as-a-learning-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Using Linux LXC virtual machines as a learning sandbox"></a>Using Linux LXC virtual machines as a learning sandbox</h3><p>A virtual machine (also called a container) is an operating system that’s been fooled into thinking that it’s all alone on it’s own computer when, in fact, it’s really the sharing hardware resources of a single computer with dozens - or even thousands - of other containers. For many reasons, software services can be offered far more efficiently when they are virtualized this way and, currently, virtualization is pretty much the dominant tool in the delivery of web services.</p>
<p>All that’s just fine, but you’re probably wondering what this has to do with us? So here’s the deal: One of the most elegant and efficient virtualization tools is LXC, which kind of stands for Linux Containers. Installing the LXC package will turn your humble PC into a fully provisioned, fire breathing virtualization host! As you’ll soon see, LXC containers can be built in just a couple of minutes and rebooted in seconds. They provide you with a clean, fully-functioning terminal environment that, for our purposes is disposable. Did you make a mistake and it no longer boots? No problem. As I’ll show you in a minute, you can easily fix most problems from the outside without booting it. But it’s usually easier just to destroy it and create a brand new one. And because it’s so well isolated, absolutely nothing you do within an LXC container will have any effect on your own host system. So the kinds of mistakes all newcomers to Linux will make as they get themselves up to speed have no serious consequences at all.</p>
<p>I therefore highly recommend that you create your own LXC containers as sandboxes for your learning experience. And that’s why I’m now going to spend a couple of minutes teaching you the basic workings of LXC container management.</p>
<p>First of all, assuming that you’re using a Ubuntu distribution, you can install the LXC package using sudo apt-get update to make sure your system is aware of the current state of the repositories, and sudo apt-get install lxc</p>
<p>That’s it. Give it a few minutes for the files to download and unpack, and you’ll be all ready to go. I’m not going to actually do this, since LXC is already installed on my machine.</p>
<p>Now let’s create our first container. By the way, all LXC commands you issue from the hypervisor require administrator rights, so you’ll need to use sudo. The command is lxc-create, which is followed by -t, telling LXC which template to use to build the new container. We’ll go with the Ubuntu template. Finally, -n tells LXC what name our new container will have. We’ll call it newpc.</p>
<p>Once newpc exists - it really only takes two or three minutes - we’ll use lxc-ls to list all the containers on the system. There’s our newpc container. Let’s start it up using sudo lxc-start -n newpc - which, obviously, will tell LXC which container to fire up. But we’ll also add -d to make sure that our shell session will be detached from the container. If we don’t do that, then the only way to exit would be by shutting down the container altogether, but we might want it to continue in the background.</p>
<p>Now let’s run lxc-ls –fancy - which will display the key details for each container…including the local private IP addresses of each container that’s currently running. This will allow us to ssh in.<br>Speaking of ssh (secure shell), you will definitely want to make sure it’s installed on your machine. If it’s not, install it using sudo apt-get install openssh-server</p>
<p>Since ssh is definitely working on my machine, we’ll use it to log in to newpc. By default, the admin user for an LXC container built with the Ubuntu template is named ubuntu, and has the password, ubuntu. Make sure you change that password if you plan to use the container for anything serious. Let’s log in.</p>
<p>And here we are, in a brand new, clean, safe, and completely isolated virtual computer. Feel free to completely mess it up.</p>
<p>I did mention before that you can easily clean up LXC messes from outside. Let’s exit the container and I’ll show you how. I will note that you might have no idea what I’m doing now, but you needn’t worry. You will certainly pick it all up once you’ve been through some of the later courses in this series, and you can always come back to this later if it’s necessary. Using a sudo shell, we’ll move to the special LXC root directory in &#x2F;var&#x2F;lib&#x2F;lxc. We can see directories for each of the containers. We’ll cd to the newpc directory, and see that there’s a file called config and another file called fstab. These are plain text files that contain configuration data defining the container. Cd’ing into the newpc directory will place us inside the container’s file system…even if the container isn’t actually running, allowing us to edit any system file that might be causing us trouble. Again, don’t worry if you don’t understand much about this last point, but it’s something you may appreciate later.</p>
<p>One final point. One reason that LXC containers are so lean and fast is because, by default, they come installed with only the base system. You may find some useful packages are missing. Now is the time to add packages like the nano text editor.</p>
<p>So let’s take a minute to sum up what we’ve learned. LXC containers are excellent environments where we can play around with a real Linux system without having to worry about breaking anything important. We create a new container using sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n newname. we list all the containers using lxc-ls, but use lxc-ls –fancy to list containers with their status and IP addresses. We boot a container using lxc-start -n newname -d - to detach our shell from the container. And we can log in to a running container using ssh ubuntu@ipaddress</p>
<p>Oh. And one more thing: you can destroy a container that’s broken or no longer needed using sudo lxc-destroy -n newname</p>
<h1 id="Series-structure"><a href="#Series-structure" class="headerlink" title="Series structure"></a>Series structure</h1><h3 id="Linux-certification-series-and-the-LPIC-1-101-and-102-exam-structure"><a href="#Linux-certification-series-and-the-LPIC-1-101-and-102-exam-structure" class="headerlink" title="Linux certification series and the LPIC-1 (101 and 102) exam structure"></a>Linux certification series and the LPIC-1 (101 and 102) exam structure</h3><p>Since <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic-1-linux-certification-introduction/introduction-to-linux/">this CloudAcademy series</a> is focused on preparing you for the the LPIC-1 Certification Exam, it makes sense for us to follow the exam objectives as closely as possible. Therefore the rest of the courses in this series will be divided into two parts. The first four courses devoted to the topics covered by the 101 Exam and the final six courses to the 102 Exam topics. Each of our courses will correspond with a single LPI Exam objective and will be very conscious of the unique weight designation, between one and five, that the LPI has assigned to each topic.</p>
<p>In other words, we’ll try to devote our attention to a particular subject in a way that’s proportional to the subject’s relative importance. Where a Linux topic has an appropriate parallel in Amazon Web Services we’ll highlight it. So for instance, when we talk about controlling access to system resources through users and groups, we’ll also briefly introduce the AWS way; Identity &amp; Access Management or IAM. When we discuss networking, we’ll add a short overview of Amazon’s Virtual Private Clouds; VPC’s.</p>
<p>Some topics like boot managers or desktops will have little or no application to cloud computing and so will therefore be discussed solely within the context of Linus systems. We don’t think there’s a combined curriculum available anywhere that can guide you to master these two giants of modern technology.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us!</p>
