<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course where I shall be looking at how AWS provides a variety of different means of authentication. My name is Stuart Scott and I’m the AWS Content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>, where one of our cloud experts will reply to your question. </p>
<p>This course has been created for those who are AWS administrators, security engineers, security architects, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of security and authentication within AWS. By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of the different methods of authentication that can be implemented when using AWS. The difference between username and password and multi-factor authentication. How to configure MFA authentication. </p>
<p>The process in which programmatic authentication is managed. How IAM roles can be used to authenticate and authorize EC2 instances to access resources. How key pairs are used to authenticate you to newly created EC2 instances, and the different options available with regard to Federated authentication. As a prerequisite to this course, you should have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of Amazon EC2, but this is not essential. </p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#x65;&#x6d;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#x65;&#x6d;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>. </p>

<h1 id="Username-Password-amp-MFA"><a href="#Username-Password-amp-MFA" class="headerlink" title="Username-Password &amp; MFA"></a>Username-Password &amp; MFA</h1><p>To begin with, I want to start talking about the AWS Identity and Access Management service. IAM is used to securely manage users who require access to your AWS account and resources. During the creation of user identities, there are components and features that you can use that affect how these users authenticate. The most basic is that of a simple username and password. These usernames must be unique as they identify you as an individual and therefore can’t be duplicated within the same account. The password however can be duplicated between different users. </p>
<p>For example, you can create 10 new IAM users, and as the administrator issue all of them with the same password. To enforce security at a greater and more granular level, IAM allows you to create and specify your own password policy for your users. This provides you with the opportunity to govern how secure you want your passwords in your environment to be. As you can see in this image, there are a variety of parameters that you can configure to adjust the policy to meet your own security standards and requirements. I would always recommend enforcing a tight security policy and adopting as many as these parameters as possible.</p>
<p>Using a username and password as your authentication mechanism, the username will be used to determine your identity, followed by verification in the form of the associated password, which must conform with your IAM password policy. On submission of the credentials, IAM will then verify if the authentication is successful and if the credentials do not match those held by IAM, access will be refused and you’ll be asked to re-enter the correct information. </p>
<p>If the authentication is successful, then the user will be authorized to access your AWS environment via the management console based on the permissions specified and associated with the IAM user. Just using a username and password for authentication is not generally considered very secure, and additional measures should be put in place, especially for those with elevated privileges. Within your IAM password policy, you might allow users to set their own passwords, and this can lead to the potential of the introduction of standard and weak passwords being entered, such as password in all lowercase, or 123456, qwerty, and letmein.</p>
<p>Although AWS allows you to enforce password policies, combinations of the above weak passwords still make their way in, such as password 123!, which is both upper and lowercase letters along with numeric and non-alphanumeric characters. However, from a security perspective, these common patterns should still be avoided. So, with this in mind, tighter security can be achieved with the use of additional authentication methods, which requires an additional level of authentication. IAM allows for Multi-Factor Authentication, MFA. This means that any user-configured to sign in with MFA must use a second step of authentication after entering the password as the first level to be authenticated, therefore giving a multi-factor layer of security. The additional authentication utilizes a random six-digit number that is generated by an MFA device that is displayed for a very short time period before the number changes again.</p>
<p>You must enter the digits displayed when prompted to verify this final step of authentication. There is no additional charge for this level of authentication, however you will need your own MFA device which can be a physical token or a virtual device. And AWS provides a summary of all supported devices here. Personally, I use Google Authenticator on my phone because it’s simple and easy to set up and configure. Before a user can authenticate with MFA, it must be configured and associated with the user. As we know as a part of the authentication process, we need to ensure that the verification part conforms the identity of the user. This configuration and association is done from within IAM. </p>
<p>And I will now show you how quick and easy this is to do via a quick demonstration. So, as you can see I’ve signed into my AWS Management Console and I’m within the AWS IAM dashboard. I’ve selected one of my users and then this is the screen I’m presented with from there. As you can see, we can manage the MFA device here. So, if I click on ‘Manage MFA’ for this user. We have a couple of options here: Virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or another hardware MFA device.</p>
<p>For this, I’m just going to use a virtual MFA device, and I’ll use the Google Authenticator app on my phone to do this, so click on ‘Continue.’ So, first of all, you need to make sure you have an app on your mobile phone or your computer. Like I said, I’m going to use the Google Authenticator app on my phone. So, what I need to do is to show the QR code. And now on my phone I’m going to add this as a new entry in my Google Authenticator app, so I’m going to click on ‘Scan QR Code.’ And then we can see at the bottom there is added the user, Patricia. </p>
<p>And then, we add in that code, so 074720. And then what we need to do is to add the second code that comes in when it appears on the Google Authenticator app. So, we just wait for that to come around then I can add in the second code, and then it will be synchronized and configured. So, this is about to change. And now I can add in the next code, 185887. And then, I click on ‘Assign MFA.’ And that’s it. So, you have successfully assigned a virtual MFA device to that user. Click on ‘Close,’ and now we can see here that there’s an assigned MFA device.</p>
<h1 id="Programmatic-Authentication"><a href="#Programmatic-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="Programmatic Authentication"></a>Programmatic Authentication</h1><p>Sometimes, if a user wants to access AWS resources, they don’t have to log into the AWS management console first. Instead, access can be gained from a programmatic perspective for a user who may be using the AWS command-line interface, the CLI, AWS API tools, tools for Windows PowerShell, or Software Development Kits, SDKs. When using any of these methods to access AWS resources, access is not granted via the AWS management console using your username and password. Instead, you’re accessing the resources programmatically and so you must authenticate differently. This is also typical of any application that calls upon functions of other services. When an identity is making programmatic calls to your AWS resources, their identity is not prompted to log into the environment first via the console. So, how do you authenticate to AWS resources?</p>
<p>But as we know, this has to happen before being authorized to perform any actions. What credentials are used and how is this authentication achieved? Identities, human or system, requiring this type of programmatic access to the AWS environment use access keys to authenticate. These access keys are composed of two elements: an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. The Access Key ID is made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters such as the one displayed on screen. The Secret Access Key is made up of 40 random upper and lowercase alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters as displayed. </p>
<p>These access keys can be created for any IAM user who requires programmatic authentication. When the keys are created, you are prompted to download and save the details as the Secret Access Key will only be displayed once. And if you lose it, then you’ll have to delete the associated Access Key ID and recreate new keys for the user. It’s worth noting that it’s not possible to retrieve lost access keys as AWS does not retain copies of these for security reasons to prevent them from being compromised. The access keys must then be applied and associated with your system or application that you require for the relevant access. </p>
<p>For example, if you’re using the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, you would first have to instruct the AWS CLI to use these access keys to authenticate and provide authorization for any programmatic API calls. The method of performing this association varies based on the application and system that you’re using. However, once this association has taken place, it ensures that all API requests made to AWS are signed with this digital signature. Before we move on, I want to give a quick demo on how we apply access keys to the AWS command-line interface using specific user’s credentials. To do this, you need to create a new access key from the security credentials tab of your IAM user and copy the access key ID and secret access key values. </p>
<p>In the following demonstration, Danny Jessee, our AWS certification specialist will now demonstrate how to use these keys to configure the AWS CLI. Once the CLI is installed, it adds a command called AWS to the system path, which I can then run from a Command Prompt along with various arguments corresponding to different AWS services, such as S3 or EC2. But before I can run any of these commands, I need to perform a one-time action to configure the credentials and default preferences I would like to use with the CLI. And to do that, I’m going to type aws configure, and first it’s going to ask me for an AWS access key ID. And so I’m going to use an access key ID from an IAM user who has already been assigned programmatic access credentials. And don’t worry, by the time you see this video, I’ll have long since deleted these credentials so they won’t be valid. </p>
<p>So, I’ll paste the access key ID here and then the secret access key. And now it’s asking me for a default region. So, you can add a – region parameter to your CLI commands to specify the exact region where you want to execute that command. But if you don’t supply this parameter, the region you specify here as your default will be used instead. So, I’ll enter us-east-1, and finally, it’s going to ask me for a default output format. And your choice here will depend on whether you prefer to see output in some sort of more friendly human-readable text format. So, my options are JSON, yaml, yaml-stream, text, or table. But for the purposes of this demo, I’ll choose text. And now that I’ve completed this initial configuration, I can begin to enter CLI commands, and these commands will execute using the credentials I just specified. </p>
<p>So, to interact with S3, I can run the command aws s3. And to list the buckets of my account, I can type ls. And here you see I have two demo buckets, but let’s say I want to add a third. So, now I can enter the command aws s3 then mb for make bucket. And the name of my new bucket will be s3:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudacademydemobucket3. And since my IAM user has permission to create an S3 bucket, this command will succeed. So, if I run aws s3 ls again, we see my newly created bucket now appears on this list. So, you see how I was able to create an S3 bucket by just running that one simple command. Now imagine if I needed to create 30 or 40 more buckets, it’s obviously much simpler and less tedious to leverage something like the AWS CLI to automate this process, rather than having to repeatedly walk through the various screens in the console.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier when talking about passwords and how it’s best practice to change the password after set period of time, the same principle applies when it comes to access keys. By rotating your access keys, you’re decreasing the likelihood of your environment or identities being compromised and gaining access to your environment. When rotating these keys, you should follow a simple five-point process to ensure you don’t lose access to your resources. Firstly, you should create a second access key. </p>
<p>Now, that includes both the access key ID and a secret access key for the same user. So, now the user has two access keys associated to them. Next, download these access keys when prompted as you won’t get the opportunity to do so again. Then associate these access keys with your application to start using the new access keys depending on what you’re using will depend on how you do this. For example, if you’re using the AWS CLI, then you would issue the command aws configure to add the new key information as we have just seen in the demonstration. Now, at this point you need to mark the existing access keys as inactive. </p>
<p>Before deleting this now inactive key, you should test your new access keys and verify that programmatic access is being allowed as expected. And then finally, delete the old access keys. As an authentication method from a programmatic perspective, access keys are a great solution. However, if you are applying access keys to applications running on EC2 instances to gain access to other AWS resources within your environment, then there is a more efficient and secure solution available. And in this instance, you should use IAM Roles.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Roles"><a href="#IAM-Roles" class="headerlink" title="IAM Roles"></a>IAM Roles</h1><p>IAM roles provide an efficient and secure solution in authenticating and authorizing access. And their usage is considered a best practice when associated with applications running on EC2 instances that require access to other resources instead of embedding credentials into the application itself. IAM roles are objects created within IAM and have a defined set of permissions associated to them, much like a normal user or user group would have. </p>
<p>However, they do not represent an identity like users do, they are simply an object with a list of authorized permissions associated. When working with Amazon EC2 instances, you can either associate a role to the instance during its creation or when it’s up and running. Once you have associated an EC2 instance with your IAM role, your application instances can then access and make API calls within AWS that are authorized by the permissions given by the role. </p>
<p>By having a role associated to the EC2 instance, there’s no need to apply access key IDs as we did previously. Instead, when your application attempts to access an AWS resource, dynamic temporary access keys will be supplied by the role to determine if access is authorized. Roles are not just for instances, they can also be assumed by a user, allowing them to switch from their current set of permissions to take the permissions given by the role. It’s important to note that permissions from the user and the IAM role are not amalgamated. </p>
<p>The permissions are swapped from the user to the IAM role. To switch to a role, permissions must first be given to the user allowing them to switch to that role, which authorizes them to use this new set of temporary permissions. Roles also take care of access key rotation as well, so there’s no need to perform your own rotation of access keys. </p>
<p>It’s more efficient to use roles for EC2 instances when requiring programmatic access over an IAM access key ID. This is because if you have multiple applications running on multiple EC2 instances, then when it comes to key rotation, you have a number of applications to associate the new keys to. To learn more about IAM roles, please see our existing course here.</p>
<h1 id="Key-Pairs"><a href="#Key-Pairs" class="headerlink" title="Key Pairs"></a>Key Pairs</h1><p>And now I want to talk about how you can authenticate to newly created instances. And the process is slightly different for Linux and Windows Operating Systems. But the underlying method is fundamentally the same through the use of key pairs. So, when you create an EC2 instance, you are asked to select an existing or create an EC2 key pair. So, what is a key pair and what does it do?</p>
<p>A key pair as the name implies is made up of two components: a public key and a private key. These keys can either be ED25519 or 2048-bit SSH-2 RSA keys. However, please note that ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances, EC2 Instance Connect, or EC2 Serial Console. The function of key pairs is to encrypt the login information for Linux and Windows EC2 instances and then decrypt the same information allowing you to authenticate onto the instance. </p>
<p>The public key uses public key cryptography to encrypt data such as the username and password. For Windows instances, the private key is used to decrypt the administrative password allowing you to gain access to the login credentials including the password using RDP. For Linux instances, the private key is used to SSH onto the instance, and the public key is held and kept by AWS. The private key is our responsibility to keep and to ensure that it is not lost. </p>
<p>So, going back to when you create your EC2 instance, you’re given the opportunity to download the key pair in the form of a pem file. Once you’ve done this, you must keep that file safe until you’re ready to log into the associated instance. It’s worth noting that you can use the same key pair on multiple instances. To understand the differences between connecting to a Windows instance and a Linux instance, please take a look at the following two labs where you will be shown how to create an instance and then connect to them using the key pairs.</p>
<h1 id="Federation"><a href="#Federation" class="headerlink" title="Federation"></a>Federation</h1><p>AWS allows you to access and manage AWS resources even if you don’t have a user account within IAM through the use of identity federation. Put simply, identity federation allows users from identity providers, IDPs, which are external to AWS to access AWS resources securely without having to supply AWS user credentials from a valid IAM user account. An example of an identity provider can be your own corporate Microsoft Active directory. </p>
<p>Federated access would then allow the users within it to access AWS. Other forms of identity providers can be any OpenID Connect Web Provider. Common examples of these are Facebook, Google, and Amazon. So, what does this mean? Well, this means that if you need users to access AWS resources that already have identities that fit into these categories, then you could allow access to your environment using these existing accounts, instead of setting up each of them with a new identity within AWS IAM, effectively allowing for a single sign-on solution. </p>
<p>As the vast majority of organizations today are using Microsoft Active Directory, this is an effective way of granting access to your AWS resources without going through the additional burden of creating IAM user accounts. As a part of the configuration process to implement federated authentication, a trust relationship between the identity provider and your AWS account must be established. AWS supports two types of identity providers, web identity federation and SAML 2.0 based federation. </p>
<p>Web identity federation allows authentication between AWS resources and any public OpenID Connect Provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon. When it’s set up and configured and access is requested by a user to an AWS resource, then the identity provider will exchange an authentication token for temporary authentication credentials. And these credentials are associated to an IAM Role with pre-configured permissions allowing authorized access to the resource as defined by that role. SAML 2.0 based federations can allow your existing Active Directory users to authenticate to your AWS resources, allowing for a single sign-on approach. </p>
<p>SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, and allows for the exchange of security data, including authentication authorization tokens to take place between an identity provider and a service provider. In this case, the identity provider is Microsoft Active Directory service and the service provider is AWS. </p>
<p>To learn more about AWS Federation and SSO, please see your exiting course here. Also, if you’re looking to provide a means of authentication to your mobile web applications, then please see our existing course which covers Amazon Cognito here. It explores Amazon Cognito and how it can be used to manage authentication and authorization to your applications. And starts with a general overview of Amazon Cognito and when to use it. It then moves on to user pools and identity pools, and how Cognito can be integrated with your mobile and web apps to sync your application’s user data across various platforms.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>If you have a look at security from an identity and authentication perspective, you could leave yourself open to security loopholes, which in turn can lead to abuse from not only internal users but external as well. Security remains high on the list for importance when it comes to cloud computing, and having an understanding of it is beneficial to your whole company. It’s the one key topic that consistently gains attention and requires constant and considerable amount of effort to get right and implement efficiently. </p>
<p>In order to do this correctly, a clear understanding and definition of security terms are essential, such as the clear differences between authentication, authorization, and access control. If you want to be an effective security engineer, you need to know the differences between these terms to allow you to select an architect the right solution to meet your needs. There are so many different methods of authentication and granting permissions. </p>
<p>It can get a little overwhelming when selecting the most effective mechanism. However, when doing so, implement the most appropriate solution that meets the security level of the data and resources that you’re protecting. If the data resource is highly sensitive, then you would implement multiple levels of authentication, such as MFA, in addition to multiple levels of authorization. The more restrictions that are in place, the harder it is to breach. I would recommend you take a look at the labs we have here at Cloud Academy as there are a number of AWS labs covering security from introduction to IAM to setting and configuring advanced roles. </p>
<p>So, feel free to take a look at these in your own time to become more familiar on how to set these up within the real environment. That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of some of the different authentication mechanisms that are available for users within AWS.

<p>Thank you!</p>
<h1 id="AWS-IAM"><a href="#AWS-IAM" class="headerlink" title="AWS IAM"></a>AWS IAM</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture, discussing how authorization is granted when working within your AWS account. Before we start, let me just highlight the difference between authentication and authorization to ensure we are clear on these two security terms which are often interchanged with one another. Authentication is the process of defining an identity and the verification of the identity. For example, a username and password. Authorization determines what identity can access within the system once it’s been authenticated. An example of this would be an identities’ permissions to access specific AWS resources.</p>
<p>As you may know, the main service responsible for managing and maintaining what an AWS identity is authorized to access is governed by the IAM service, identity and access management. So, let’s start with IAM and how these permissions are implemented and associated with different identities, allowing the authorization of using specific services to carry out certain functions. When an identity is authenticated to AWS, the way in which permissions are given to the identity varies depending on the identities own user permissions and its association with other IAM groups and roles.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick recap on users groups and roles. The IAM users are account objects that allow an individual user to access your AWS environment with a set of credentials. You can issue user accounts to anyone who needs to view or administer objects and resources within your AWS environment. Permissions can be applied individually to a user, but the best practice for permission assignments is to add the user to an IAM user group. IAM user groups are objects that have permissions assigned to them via policies, allowing the members of the group to access specific resources.</p>
<p>Having users assigned to these groups allows for a uniformed approach to managing access and control. IAM roles are objects which have policy permissions associated to them. However, instead of just being associated with users as groups are, roles can be associated to EC2 instances or other AWS services as service controls. If associated with an EC2 instance, this allows the instance to adopt permissions given by the role without the need to have access keys stored locally.</p>
<p>Permissions are granted to users, users groups, and roles by means of an AWS IAM policy written as a JSON script. There are a number of privates in AWS policies which are classed as AWS managed policies, but you can also create your own custom-managed policies as well. AWS managed policies cover a huge range of AWS services which authorize you to carry out different tasks through varied levels of access, from read-only to full access and everything in between. If your security requirements fit with one of these AWS managed policies, then that’s great and you can start using it right away by associating users, user groups, or roles to it. However, if it’s more likely that these AWS-managed policies are not a perfect match for permissions you want to assign to an authenticated user, then in this instance you can copy and tweak the policy and make it fit for your requirements exactly.</p>
<p>When it comes to security, you cannot be lazy as this leads to mistakes and vulnerabilities. You can’t afford to take shortcuts and you need to define your permissions ensuring they only allow authorized access to services and features that are required, also known as the principle of least privilege.</p>
<p>IAM policies are made up of statements following a set syntax for allowing or denying permissions to resources within AWS. And each policy will have at least one statement within the structure that resembles the following. So, the statement: This defines the main element of the policy and groups together the permissions defined within it via the following attributes. Effect: This will either be set to Allow or Deny, and these are explicit. By default, access to your resources are denied, and so therefore, if this is set to Allow, it replaces the default Deny. Similarly, if this was configured as Deny, it would override any previous Allow.</p>
<p>Action: This corresponds to API calls to AWS services. This example represents an API call to delete a bucket, an action within S3. You are able to list multiple actions if required by using a comma to separate them as shown here. Wildcards are also allowed. So, for example, you could create an action to carry out all APIs relating to S3. Resources: This specifies the actual resource you wish the permissions to be applied to. AWS uses unique identifiers known as ARNs, Amazon Resource Names, to specify resources. Typically, ARNs follow the following syntax. Let’s break this down and take a look at each of these segments.</p>
<p>Partition: This relates to the partition that the resources found in. For standard AWS regions, this section would be AWS.</p>
<p>Service: This reflects the specific AWS service, for example, S3 or EC2.</p>
<p>Region: This is the region where the resource is located. Now remember, some services do not need a region specified. So, this can sometimes be left blank in no circumstances.</p>
<p>Account ID: This is your AWS account ID without hyphens. Again, there are some services that do not need this information and so it can be left blank.</p>
<p>Resource: The value of this field will depend on the AWS service you are using. For example, if I were using the action s3:DeleteBucket, then I could use the bucket name that I wanted the permission to delete, and in this example cloudacademy is the name of the bucket.</p>
<p>Condition: This element of the IAM policy is an optional element that allows you to specify when the permissions will be activated based upon set conditions. Conditions use key value pairs and all conditions must be met for the permission to be activated. For example, there may be a condition only permitting requests from a specific source IP address.</p>
<p>Now, we have a basic understanding of how JSON scripts are put together and their general flow, I want to show you how to create and modify AWS IAM policies using a variety of different methods. Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS management console and I’m at the IAM dashboard and I’ve gone into Policies. So, from here, we can create a number of different IAM policies. And the first method I’m going to show you is how to copy and import an existing AWS managed policy to create your own if you need to make a few changes to it. So, let’s go ahead and do that now.</p>
<p>So, from here, we need to go across to Create policy. Now from here, we have an option on the top right here called Import managed policy, and that’s what we want to do. I want to import an AWS managed policy and then make a couple of small changes to it. So, if I select Import managed policy and then find the policy that I want to find. So, let’s for example look at Amazon S3 full access, import that. And we can see here that it’s imported the data. And if we look at the JSON tab, we can actually see the JSON format of that policy, and from here we can directly make changes.</p>
<p>So, for this quick demonstration, I want to copy this existing policy, but instead of allowing any resource, I want to specify my own resource for this, which would mean instead of this policy being allowed full access to Amazon S3, it allows full access to a specific bucket on Amazon S3. So, let me go ahead and make those changes now. So, I’m going to change the Asterix from resource and put in my own specific ARN of a bucket. So, now I’ve changed the resource to my own ARN.</p>
<p>So now, all I need to do is click on ‘Next’, go to Tags and I can add any optional tags if I want to, I’m just going to leave that blank for this demonstration. Go across to Review, and here I can give this new policy a name. So, I can call S3FullAccessToMyBucket, and description this allows for full S3 access to CA bucket UK. And it gives you a summary of the policy here, so we can see the service that it’s using, the access level, and also the resource. Once we’re happy with that, we can simply click on ‘Create policy’. And we can see that that policy has now been created. Now, if we have a look at that policy just by clicking on it there will take us straight to it and we can see the JSON version of the policy. So, that’s a very quick and easy way if you want to save yourself some time by copying existing S3 managed policies that are already there.</p>
<p>Now, I chose a fairly simple policy just for a demonstration, but there are some quite complex policies that AWS already have that you might need to just tweak a few changes to so you can simply import those existing managed policies, make your changes, and then save it as a new customer managed policy. Okay, so that’s the first method covered.</p>
<p>Now, next I want to show you how to create a policy using something called the AWS policy generator. Now, if you simply go to Google and type in the AWS policy generator, then it will come up straight away, and you’ll be brought to a page like this. Now, the actual URL of this policy generator, if you’d prefer to type it in is awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;policygen.html. So, this is a policy generator and it allows you to easily create different types of AWS policies.</p>
<p>So, if we look at this drop down list here, we can create an SQS queue policy, an S3 bucket policy, which as we know is a resource based policy, a VPC endpoint policy, an IAM policy, and an SNS topic policy. We’re interested in the IAM policy. So, if we select that, now in Step 2 we can add our statement. Now here, we have our effect which can be allow or deny. So, let’s say allow for this example. And then we can select the service that we’re interested in. Let’s select Amazon S3 to keep it nice and simple. Now, we can select our actions.</p>
<p>Now, we can select individual actions here just through these tick boxes for any actions that we’re interested in. So, I’ll just select a number of different ones there. And you can see here, that it’s selected five actions. If you wanted all actions, you would simply tick this box and then you’d put in the ARN in the bucket. So, let’s just put in that same bucket that we used in the previous example, and then here we can also add in any conditions that we’d like. So, just through a series of dropdown boxes you can specify any conditions that you’d like in there as well. And then once you’re happy with your policy, simply select ‘Add statement’. And here it breaks down a summary as well. So, it shows the effect, the action, and the actions that we selected, the resource, and if there’s any conditions which we didn’t specify any.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to we can now add an additional statement. So, for example, if we wanted to add some RDS elements in here as well, we can select AWS service, select a load of actions, put in the ARN of your RDS database, and also add that statement to the same policy. Now, once you’re happy with your policy and the number of statements that you’ve added, simply click ‘Generate Policy’. And here it shows you the JSON view of the policy that you would need based on your dropdown selection. So, what we can do now is simply copy that, go back to IAM, go to your policies, create policy, go to the JSON tab, and simply paste it in. So, it’s a very quick way of creating a policy through a series of dropdown boxes. And again, you can just progress through adding any tags that you need to do, give this a name, ThisIsMyPolicy, and then click ‘Create policy’. And again, you can see that this is been created. You can select that, and again we can see that the JSON statement there.</p>
<p>So, now we’ve looked at how to create a policy by copying an existing AWS managed policy, we’ve looked at how to use the policy generator. Now, let’s just quickly review how to create a policy from scratch. So again, go back to Policies and then Create policy. Now, you can either use this visual editor or go straight to JSON and you can start typing out your policy in here as and how you need it, or you can use the visual editor which is very similar to the policy generator we just looked at, where, again, you can choose a service then the specific actions, say all S3 actions. Then you can specify the resources, whether you want this against an access point, a bucket, a job, an object. So, you can say any object, then you can specify any conditions if you need MFA or specific source IP for example. And again, you can also add additional permissions here.</p>
<p>So, almost like another statement, it’s very similar to the policy generator, but for me personally I think the policy generator is slightly easier to understand. And then once you have your settings as you want them, and this has all been prefilled from the options from the visual editor, and again click ‘Tags’, and then ‘Review’, and then give this a name; MyPolicy. And then go to Create policy. If we take a look at the policy, we can just see its details again. And again, this shows the JSON view etc. And if we wanted to edit the policy directly here, then we can click on ‘Edit’, and you can either edit through the visual editor or you can directly edit the JSON view as well. So, that’s just a couple of ways of creating your IAM policies in a few very simple steps. There are many commands that can be applied and controlled through an IAM policy, but they’re a bit beyond the scope of this course. However, AWS does provide great API listings for the different services through their extensive documentation for advanced policy writers.</p>
<h1 id="Amazon-S3"><a href="#Amazon-S3" class="headerlink" title="Amazon S3"></a>Amazon S3</h1><p>Amazon S3 is one of AWS’ most common storage services for customers in addition to being integrated with a multitude of other AWS services. So it’s worth devoting some time to see how S3 handles its own authorization mechanisms. There are multiple ways identities can be authorized to access an object within S3, some of which overlap with the IAM mechanisms we have already discussed. </p>
<p>So how does a user or service get authorization to access S3 without using IAM policies? First, let’s define the different methods that permissions can be applied from within S3.</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 bucket policies </li>
<li>And S3 ACLs, Access Control Lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Bucket policies are similar to IAM policies, in that they allow access to resources via a JSON script. However, as the name implies, these bucket policies are only applied to buckets within S3 and act as resource-based policies, whereas IAM policies can be assigned to users, groups, or roles as we previously discussed, and are classed as identity-based policies.</p>
<p>When a bucket policy is applied, the permissions assigned apply to all objects within that bucket. This policy introduces a new attribute called principals. These principals can be IAM users, federated users, another AWS account, or even other AWS services, and it defines which principals should be allowed or denied access to various S3 resources. Principals are not used within IAM identity-based policies as the principal element is defined by who is associated to that policy via the user, group, or role association. As bucket policies are assigned to buckets, we need to have this additional parameter of principals within the policy to ensure the policy is being checked against the correct person or service.</p>
<p>As you can see from this example a bucket policy is very similar in terms of layout and syntax to that of an IAM policy. However, we do have the Principal attribute added. This value refers to the ARN of the principal, and in this example, we can see that it points to cloudacademy as a user within IAM, and this user is allowed to delete objects and put objects within the cloudacademy bucket identified under the resource parameter. </p>
<p>S3 bucket policies also allow you to set conditions within the policy, allowing a fine-grain permission set to be defined. For example, you could allow or deny specific IP subnets to access the bucket, or perhaps even restrict a specific IP address. This is another level of access control taking place at the network level that helps to tighten access, ensuring only authorized access is permitted.</p>
<p>S3 Access control lists, or ACLs allow you to control access to buckets, in addition to specific objects within a bucket by groupings and AWS accounts. One advantage of being able to use ACLs is that you can set different permissions per object.</p>
<p>ACLs do not follow the same JSON format as the policies defined by IAM and bucket policies. Instead, they are far less granular, and different permissions can be applied depending if you are applying an ACL at the bucket level or the object level. Due to the basic structure of an ACL it is not possible to implicitly deny access using ACLs, neither are you able to implement conditional elements like we saw earlier when I mentioned identity-based access. </p>
<p>An example of a default ACL for a bucket looks as shown. As you can see here, you can specify different permissions for different predefined S3 groups defined by the Grantee column.</p>
<p>Permissions are based on the Grantee, of which there are 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bucket Owner, this will be your own AWS account and will have full control over all objects and the bucket itself</li>
<li>Everyone (public access), permissions set against this grantee would mean anyone can access the content using the permissions applied, providing the object had been made public. These requests can be signed (authenticated) or unsigned (unauthenticated)</li>
<li>Authenticated Users - This option will allow IAM users from any AWS account to access the object, via signed requests (authenticated)</li>
<li>S3 Log delivery group - This is a group used to deliver log files when server access logs has been configured and the bucket is used to store and WRITE log files to</li>
</ul>
<p>By editing the ACL at the bucket level you will be presented with the following.</p>
<p>This shows you the different levels of permissions that can be applied to the Bucket. It will show you the permissions given to the grantee groups for the bucket, which are either List or Write. You can also see what permissions have been given to enable the grantees access to either Read or Write against the Bucket ACL. </p>
<p>For clarification about what these permissions actually grant, they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>List: (Allows the grantee to list objects in the bucket)</li>
<li>Write: (Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket)</li>
<li>Bucket ACL Read (Allows the grantee to read the ACL of the bucket)</li>
<li>Bucket ACL Write: (Allows the grantee to write the ACL for the bucket)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that you can also add access for another account as a Grantee. To configure this access you will be required to enter the Canonical ID of the AWS account that you would like to have access.</p>
<p>So we have seen what the ACL Looks like at the Bucket level, let’s now take a quick look at what it looks like at the object level. </p>
<p>Here is an ACL of an object within a bucket. </p>
<p>As you can see, again by default the resource owner has full control over the object. Also, you will also notice that you can add access for another account, again you will need to add the appropriate canonical AWS Account ID and the relevant permissions.</p>
<p>You can also specify Public access (if you have Public access enabled). In this example, we can see that the ‘Everyone’ Group has Read access to the Object. To modify this permission I could simply click on the radio button next to the group and modify the settings as shown: </p>
<p>Note there is no WRITE permission when working with object ACLs, unlike Bucket ACLs.</p>
<p>Again, let’s take a closer look at what actual permissions are being applied depending on the option chosen for the object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Object: (Allows the grantee to read the object data and its metadata)</li>
<li>Read object permissions: (Allows grantee to read the object ACL)</li>
<li>Write object permissions (Allows the grantee to write the ACL for the object)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have spoken about a number of ways an identity or principal can be authorized access to a resource or object within AWS, but what happens if a principal who belongs to an IAM group and accesses an object in a bucket with S3 ACLs, bucket permissions and their own IAM permissions? With all of this authorization, how is this access governed if there are conflicting permissions to the object in the bucket that they are trying to access?</p>
<p>Well, AWS handles this permission conflict in accordance with the basis of least privilege. Essentially, by default, AWS dictates that access is denied to an object, even without an explicit Deny within any policy. To gain access, there has to be an Allow within a policy that the principal is associated to or defined by within a bucket policy or ACL. If there are no Denies defined, but there is an Allow within a policy, then access will be authorized. However, if there is a single Deny associated with a principal to a specific object, then even if an Allow does exist, this explicit Deny will always take precedence, overruling the Allow, and access will not be authorized.</p>
<h1 id="Network-Access-Control-Lists-NACLs"><a href="#Network-Access-Control-Lists-NACLs" class="headerlink" title="Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)"></a>Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)</h1><p>If you have been working with VPCs for any length of time then you would have come across AWS Network Access Control Lists, also known as NACLs, and these can be considered a way of authorizing network packets to enter and leave different parts of your VPC. Operating the Network layer, NACLs provide a rule-based security feature for permitting ingress and egress network traffic at the protocol and subnet level. In other words, ACLs monitor and filter traffic moving in and out of your subnet, either allowing or denying access dependent on rule permissions. </p>
<p>NACLs can be attached to one or more subnets within your virtual private cloud. If you haven’t created a custom NACL, then your subnets will automatically be associated with your VPC’s default NACL, and in this instance, the default allows all traffic to flow in and out of the network, as opposed to denying it.</p>
<p>The rule set itself is very simple, and has both an inbound and outbound list of rules, and these rules are comprised of just six different fields; these being </p>
<ol>
<li>Rule Number: ACL rules are read in ascending order, and as soon as a network packet is received, it reads each rule in ascending order until a match is found. For this reason, you’ll want to carefully sequence your rules with an organized numbering system. I would suggest that you leave a gap of at least 50 between each of your rules to allow you to easily add new rules in sequence later if it becomes necessary. </li>
<li>Type: this dropdown list allows you to select from a list of common protocol types, including SSH, RDP, HTTP, and POP3. You can alternatively specify custom protocols, such as varieties of ICMP. </li>
<li>Protocol: based on your choice of ‘Type’, the protocol option might be grayed out. For custom rules like TCP and UDP, however, you should provide a value. </li>
<li>Port Range: If you create a custom rule, you’ll need to specify the port range for the protocol to use. </li>
<li>Source: this can be a net or a subnet range, a specific IP address, or even left open to traffic from anywhere. </li>
<li>Allow&#x2F;Deny: Each rule must include an action specifying whether to Allow or Deny the traffic that meets the parameters of the rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>So NACLs are not used to authorize an identity as such, instead, they are used to effectively authorize the network packet itself to enter or leave a specific subnet. It’s important to note that NACLs are stateless. Therefore, when creating your rules, you’ll need to apply an outbound reply rule to permit responses to inbound requests.</p>
<h1 id="Security-Groups"><a href="#Security-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Security Groups"></a>Security Groups</h1><p>AWS security groups are associated with EC2 instances, and provide security at the protocol and port access level, much like Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and as a result, they also work much the same way. Containing a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance, authorizing which communication can occur between instances. However, unlike NACLs, with security groups, there isn’t a Deny action for a rule. Instead, if there isn’t a rule that explicitly permits a particular packet, it will simply be dropped. The rule set is made up of two rule sets, inbound and outbound.</p>
<p>Security groups are stateful, meaning you do not need the same rules for both inbound and outbound traffic for response traffic, unlike, NACLs, which are stateless. Therefore, any rule that authorizes traffic into an EC2 instance will allow any response to be returned without an explicit rule in the outbound ruleset.</p>
<p>Each rule is comprised of 8 fields: </p>
<ol>
<li>Name: As expected this allows you to add a name for the rule up to 255 characters in length</li>
<li>Security Group Rule ID: This is automatically created and set a unique identifier for the security group rule</li>
<li>IP Version: Here you can select which IP version that the security group apples to, V4 or V6</li>
<li>Type: This dropdown list allows you to select common protocols like SSH, RDP, HTTP. You can also choose custom protocols. </li>
<li>Protocol: This is typically grayed out, as it’s covered by most type choices. However, if you create a custom rule, you can specify your protocol here</li>
<li>Port range: This value will also usually be pre-filled, reflecting the default port range for your chosen protocol. However, there might be times when you prefer to use custom ports. </li>
<li>Source: This can be a net or subnet range, a specific IP address, or another AWS security group. You can also leave access open to the entire internet using the Anywhere value. </li>
<li>Description: This simply allows you to add a description for the rule itself</li>
</ol>
<p>In this screenshot, we can clearly see that authorization is permitted if the source IP address is 94.118.90.66&#x2F;32 and is using SSH across TCP on port 22. Security groups are a great way to authorize the use of particular ports for communication, whilst restricting all other communication over denied ports.</p>
<p>For example, you could have a number of SQL RDS instances that you want to write to from a group of EC2 instances. In this case, you could create a security group for the SQL RDS instances and another security group for the EC2 instances. You could then authorize communication to happen over specified permitted ports, such as 1433 and 1434, used by SQL, between the two groups. All other communication will be dropped and denied, which in turn enhances security on your AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course. You should now have a greater understanding of the different methods that AWS implements to authorize access within your AWS account.</p>

<h1 id="The-Difference-Between-Authentication-Authorization-and-Access-Control"><a href="#The-Difference-Between-Authentication-Authorization-and-Access-Control" class="headerlink" title="The Difference Between Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control"></a>The Difference Between Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control</h1><p>When talking about security, I find that there can be a lot of confusion around the definition and meaning of the words authentication, authorization, and access control. Many people believe they all mean the same thing with no clear distinction between them. This is, however, untrue, and as a result people often use the wrong term to describe a security mechanism. So in this course, I want to cover each of these to help you understand the differences. It’s important to know these differences in order to control access to your cloud resources effectively and with the appropriate level of security. </p>
<p>My name is Stuart Scott, and I am the AWS content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen, alternatively you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>So getting back to the topic in question, let’s start by looking at Authentication in more detail. </p>
<p>The authentication process is comprised of two parts of information. The first part of this process is to define who you are, effectively presenting your identity. An example of this would be your login username to your AWS account. This identification is a unique value within your AWS account that you are trying to authenticate to, and so as a result of it being unique, AWS would not allow two identical usernames to be created within the same single AWS account.</p>
<p>The second part of the authentication process is to verify that you are who you say you are in the first step. This is achieved by providing additional information which should be kept private and secret for security purposes. However, unlike the username, this private information does not have to be a unique value within your AWS account. So in the example I just gave whereby you provide your identity in the form of a username to your AWS account, which will be a unique value, the next step would be to verify that identity by providing a password.</p>
<p>Putting AWS and the cloud to one side for a moment, usernames and passwords are just one form of authentication used in an identity and verification process. In our everyday lives, we are presented with multiple forms of authentication methods without even thinking about it. For example, credit and debit cards and pin numbers. So, when we use these to pay for something we authenticate to our banks. In this process, we first identify ourselves by providing the credit card details with our personal information on it and then verify this identification by entering a private pin number. This combination then allows us to authenticate to our banks. </p>
<p>Another example might be with the use of biometrics, you might need to gain access to a secure room in your building, firstly you can present your identification card as your identity, and then this is authorized by presenting your fingerprint or retina scan, and therefore confirming you are who you say you are with the identity you provided.  </p>
<p>Authentication is not just for verifying human access to systems or areas. Authentication takes place by IT services and applications that require access to other systems. For example, an EC2 instance might require access to Amazon S3 to perform routine tasks. In this instance, the same authentication principles and process is followed. Identity first, and then verification of that identity.</p>
<p>Now that we have a clear definition of authentication, let’s take a look at authorization and see how authentication and authorization differ from each other. Authorization only takes place once an identity has been authenticated, so there is a clear order as to which these two operate. </p>
<p>Authentication takes place before the correct level of authorization can be attained. Authorization is the process in which an identity that has been authenticated establishes what level of access can and can’t be achieved. So here, we are really looking at access privileges and permissions. </p>
<p>Staying with an AWS example, let’s assume we have an authenticated user that has entered their username and password. AWS security features, and in this case, AWS IAM, identity and access management service, defines the level of authorized access assigned to that identity within the AWS environment. Each identity can have a different level of authorization permissions associated to it. It’s these properties that determine what that identity can then access.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have four identities within our AWS account. Stuart, Will, Jorge, and Andy. Once authenticated, AWS will then determine their authorization levels.</p>
<p>This table shows the high-level authorization information. From this, we can see that Stuart is authorized to have full access to the complete AWS S3 service. Will is authorized to only Create instances from within Amazon EC2. Jorge is authorized to only create volumes within Amazon EBS. And Andy is authorized to both create and delete users within IAM.</p>
<p>So there is a clear distinction between authentication and authorization. Authentication identifies and verifies who you are. Authorization determines what an identity can access within a system once it has been authenticated to it.</p>
<p>Now how does access control fit into all this? Specifically logical access controls. Again, access control is defined as something different from authentication and authorization. When looking at Logical Access Control, we can hone in on the mechanisms or methods of accessing a secured resource. </p>
<p>Let’s put some examples in context around this to make it a little clearer. So when a user logs on with a username and password, as per our previous example, this mechanism of logical access control, in its most simple form, can be classed as a username&#x2F;password method. If we were to enforce tighter security controls and introduce Multi-Factor authentication, MFA, then this would be an enhanced level of access control as it uses an additional token to complete the authentication process. So you can look at logical access control in the eyes of the entire process of how access is granted to a resource. </p>
<p>There are of course many other logical access control mechanisms within the AWS environment that you may come across. So another method of access control within AWS can be that of IAM roles, where roles are used to grant permissions to perform specific functions which can be associated to users or other resources and services.</p>
<p>Another example is Federation, this is where access is granted to users that do not have identities within AWS IAM, instead, temporary credentials are supplied to gain access. For example, a user account within a corporate on-site Microsoft active directory can be federated to access AWS resources. </p>
<p>Network access control lists or NACLs. This method is performed at the network level restricting data dependent on specific network parameters such as IP address, protocols, and ports. For example, only allowing SSH access to a particular subnet from a specific network range. </p>
<p>Security groups: similar principles to NACLs, but they operate at the instance level. So, again access control is based on IP address and port information. </p>
<p>So, as you can see, access control is not always related to a human activity whereby usernames and passwords are used to simply log into a system or application.</p>
<p>Access control is very closely related to both authentication and authorization as the access control mechanism typically is used for both authentication and authorization to gain access to a resource.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, I feel it’s important to really understand the difference between the three terms we have just covered. </p>
<p>Authentication: the process of defining an identity and the verification of that identity. An example would be a username and password. </p>
<p>Authorization: determines what an identity can access within a system once it’s been authenticated to it. An example of this would be an identity’s permissions to access specific AWS services. </p>
<p>Access control: the method and process of how access is granted to a secure resource. An example, multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of the difference between each of these terms and that you see the clear difference between them. AWS has services and features for the three mechanisms we have just learned, and so it’s important we use these in the correct context and not confuse ourselves and others between their meaning.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you could contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. </p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course, where I shall be looking at how IAM Policies can be used to allow you to both grant and restrict access to your resources within your AWS account. I shall be looking at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/iam-aws-policy-types/">different types of policies</a>, in addition to the syntax of them, and how to interpret a policy. My name is Stuart Scott, and I’m the AWS Content Director here, at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions, using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us, here at Cloud Academy, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>, where one of our Cloud Experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this course has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles; an AWS administrator, security engineer, security architect, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS certification. By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of the different types of IAM policies you can expect to see when working within IAM; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/creating-an-aws-iam-policy/">how to implement policies</a> effectively to build secure and robust access controls for your users; how to read IAM policies to understand the permissions they are granting and restricting; and how <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/policy-evaluation-logic/">policy evaluation logic</a> operates.</p>
<p>As an intermediate course, you should already have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of its core services, but this is not essential.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses, here at Cloud Academy, is valuable to both us as trainers, and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.

<h1 id="IAM-AWS-Policy-Types"><a href="#IAM-AWS-Policy-Types" class="headerlink" title="IAM AWS Policy Types"></a>IAM AWS Policy Types</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I want to talk about four different policy types that you can expect to see when working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam/introduction-81/">AWS IAM</a>. Identity-based policies. These policies can be attached to users, user groups or roles within IAM. Essentially, any entity that depicts an identity. Resource-based policies. Instead of being associated with an identity, these policies are attached in line to resources themselves. An example of a resource-based policy in IAM will be that of a role trust policy where the policy defines the principle that can assume the role.</p>
<p>Permission boundaries. These policies can be associated with a role or user, but they don’t actually grant permissions themselves, instead they define the maximum level of permissions that can be granted to an entity. Organization service control policies, SCPs. These are very similar to permission boundaries in the fact that they do not grant permissions. They define a boundary of maximum permissions. However, these service control policies are associated with an AWS account or organizational unit, an OU, when working with AWS organizations and govern the maximum permissions to the members of those accounts.</p>
<p>With all of these policy types, it’s easy to see why some people can get confused as to which type of policy is being used or should be used. So let me run through each of these policies in greater detail, starting with the identity-based policies.</p>
<p>As already highlighted, these policies can be attached to users, user groups, or roles and they control what permissions each of those entities have. Identity-based policies can either be managed or inline policies, but what does this mean? Well, managed policies are saved within the IAM library of policies and can be attached to any user, user group or role as and when required, and the same policy can be attached to multiple entities.</p>
<p>Managed policies also come in two different flavors, AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. AWS managed policies are policies that have been pre-configured by AWS and made available to you to help you manage some of the most common permissions that you may wish to assign. Some examples of AWS managed policies can be seen here. From the policy name, you can usually tell what access is being given, although you can expand upon each policy to see the JSON document that is associated.</p>
<p>Customer managed policies are those that you have created yourself, which can then be associated with a user, user group or role. You might want to create customer managed policies when the AWS managed policies do not meet your security requirements. For example, you might want to add additional granularity to the policy to restrict access at a specific API call level.</p>
<p>Let me now explain how inline policies contrast against managed policies. So inline policies are embedded directly into the entity, either the user, user group or role. The policy is not saved and stored in the IAM library policy, its only existence is within the associated entity. As a result, it can’t easily be replicated to other entities, it’s specific to that one user, user group or role, creating a one-to-one relationship. It’s not always best practice to use inline policies as they take a lot of administration to keep on top of and should only be used if absolutely necessary. For example, you might have some elevated permissions that you don’t want to have mistakenly given to someone else that they weren’t intended for.</p>
<p>Okay, let me now move onto resource-based policies. So resource-based policies are effectively inline policies that are associated with a resource instead of an identity. If you have been using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-to-amazon-s3/introduction/">Amazon S3</a> for any extended period of time, then you may have come across S3 bucket policies, which is a common resource-based policy where permissions to the bucket are defined at the resource level and defined which principle or principles can access the bucket based upon different actions.</p>
<p>When using roles within IAM, the role has a trust relationship policy, which is a resource-based policy. As a result, the permissions of the trust are embedded inline within the role itself. So in this instance, the resource is the role and the resource-based policy is the trust relationship. This example shows the resource-based policy of the trust relationship of one of my roles. In this policy, the user, Stuart is the principle and has the ability to assume the role. It is this parameter of principle which signifies the difference between an identity-based policy and a resource-based policy.</p>
<p>Identity-based policies don’t have that principle parameter as the policy is already associated within the identity. Resource-based policies must have the principle parameter to determine which identity that the policy permissions relate to. Next up, we have permission boundaries. So permission boundaries can only be associated with a user or role. It’s not possible to add a boundary to a group. They differ from both identity-based and resource-based policies in the fact that permission boundaries don’t grant permissions themselves. They act as a guide rail to limit the maximum level of permissions that the user or role can be given. The policy configured for the boundary can be an AWS managed or customer managed policy.</p>
<p>So let’s assume for example, that our user, Stuart has an identity-based policy associated with him that allows full access to S3 and full access to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2/amazon-ec2/">EC2</a> using the following AWS managed policies. However, if a permission boundary was also configured for Stuart using the following AWS managed policies, which only grants read only access to S3, but still full access to EC2, then the resulting access for the user, Stuart would be full access to EC2, but only read only to Amazon S3 as the maximum permission defining by the permissions boundary was limited to read only despite the user having an identity-based policy associated granting full S3 access.</p>
<p>So the last policy I want to reference are the SCPs, the service control policies. So service control policies are used by AWS organizations and attached to AWS accounts or organizational units, OUs, to define the maximum permissions allowed for the members of the associated account or OU. So in a way they act in a similar fashion to that of permission boundaries, but at the account level and affect all members of those accounts.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS and EC2 via an identity-based policy. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2 despite having full access to S3. The SCP would serve to prevent service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<p>So to be clear, an SCP does not grant access, they add a guide route to define what is allowed. You’ll still need to configure your identity-based or resource-based policies to identities, granting permission to carry out actions within your accounts. If you want to use service control policies to help you manage your security at an account level, then you need to ensure that you deploy AWS organizations using the enable all feature setting.</p>
<p>Within IAM, you have the ability to view any SCPs that are applicable to your AWS account, the policy statement itself, it’s ARN, the number of entities it affects and you can also review access activity to learn when a principal within the organization last accessed a service. However, if you wanted to update or edit the SCP, then you’d have to do that from within the AWS organization service itself. The SCP can’t be edited from within IAM. For more information relating to how to implement, manage and secure AWS organizations using SCPs, then please see our existing course here.</p>
<h1 id="Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure"><a href="#Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Examining the JSON Policy Structure"></a>Examining the JSON Policy Structure</h1><p>In this lecture, I will be taking a deep look at the syntax and structure of IAM policies. For both identity-based and resource-based policies, the syntax is the same, but you might use slightly different parameters. If you’ve worked with IAM at all before, then I am sure you have come across an IAM policy. After all, it is the component that defines what an identity can or can’t access. But what do these policies actually look like? IAM policies are formatted as JSON documents, JavaScript Object Notation, and each policy will have at least one statement where the structure may look like this example.</p>
<p>Let me break the structure of this policy down to allow you to understand each element. Version. This specifies the policy language version and specifies the language syntax used, and at the time of writing this course, the current policy version is 2012-10-17. Statement. This defines the main element of the policy, which will includes other sub-elements, including the Sid, Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition. These elements will identify the level of access granted or denied and to which resource. A policy must contain at least one statement, but it can also contain an array of statements. For each statement block, it must be enclosed within curly braces, but if you use an array of statements, then you must enclose the entire array within square brackets. And we shall look at an example of this during this lecture.</p>
<p>Sid. This is the statement ID, and it’s an optional parameter that allows you to set a unique identifier within the statement. As you add more arrays within your policy, it can be a good idea to include a Sid for each one, allowing you to name them appropriately, making them more easily identifiable. For example, AllowGetObjectForS3. Without reading the rest of the statement, you can get a good idea of what the permissions in this statement allows.</p>
<p>Effect. This element can be set to either Allow or Deny, which either grant or restrict access for the actions defined in the statement. By default, all access to your resources are denied and so, therefore, if this is set to Allow, it replaces the default denied access. Similarly, if this was set to Deny, it would override any previous Allow. An explicit Deny in a policy will always take precedence over any Allow.</p>
<p>Principal. This parameter defines which principal the policy relates to. The Principal is only used for resource-based policies, for example, those policies attached to S3 Buckets. When using identity-based policies, this parameter is not required within the policy as the policy itself is associated with the principal and not a resource. As an alternative to the Principal parameter, this could be replaced with the NotPrincipal parameter, which would specify the user, role, or AWS account that is not allowed or denied access to the associated resource.</p>
<p>Action. This is the action that will either be allowed or denied, depending on the value entered for the Effect parameter. Actions are effectively API calls for different services. As a result, different actions are used for each service. For example the DeleteBucket action is available for S3 but not EC2, and likewise, the CreateKeyPair action is available for EC2 but not S3. The action is prefixed with the associated AWS service. This example defines two actions, CreateTrail and DeleteTrail, for the CloudTrail service. As another example, you can see this one here with the asterisk, and this acts as a wildcard which represents all actions for the CloudTrail service, essentially granting full access to the service.</p>
<p>Similarly, as we had with the Principal parameter, we could replace the Action parameter with the NotAction instead, and this could help you optimize your policy by creating a shorter version, listing just a limited set of actions that should not match instead of creating a longer policy listing all that actions that should. An example of using the NotAction is shown here. This policy essentially allows all actions for CloudTrail apart from the DeleteTrail API, and this is because the NotAction parameter is being used.</p>
<p>Resource. This element specifies the actual resource you wish the Action and Effect to be applied to. AWS uses identifiers known as ARNs, Amazon Resource Names, to specify specific resources. Typically, ARNs follow a syntax of, arn, partition, service, region, account-id, and then resource. So the Partition element, this relates to the partition that the resource is found in. For standard AWS regions, this would be AWS. Service. This reflects the specific AWS service, for example, S3 or EC2.</p>
<p>Region. This is the region where the resource is located. Some services do not need a region specified, so this can sometimes be left blank. Account-ID. This is your AWS Account ID, without hyphens. Again, some services do not need this information and so can be left blank. Resource. The value of this field will depend on the AWS service you are using. For example, if I were using the action, Action:s3:PutObject, then I could use the bucket name that I wanted those permissions to apply to. Again, we also have a NotResource parameter that can be used to explicitly match all other resources except those specified. For example, this policy will allow access to all S3 buckets other than those specified by the NotResource parameter.</p>
<p>Condition. This is an optional element that allows you to control when the permissions will be effective based upon set criteria. The element itself is made up of a condition and a key value pair and all elements of the condition must be met for the permissions to be active. Let’s take a look at an example condition. In the example, the IP address is the condition itself, which the key value pair will be effective against. The aws:SourceIp is the Key and the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 is the value element of the key. So effectively, what this is saying is, if the Source IP address of the user who is requesting access via the policy is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range, then implement the permissions in the policy statement.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gone through the core parameters of an IAM policy, let’s take a look at a couple of examples to ensure we can understand the permissions that are being presented within the policy. As I mentioned previously, you can have multiple Sids within a statement, each granting a different level of access. The example below demonstrates this, and I have highlighted each a different color to show the separation.</p>
<p>So looking at this example policy, let’s determine what access is being granted. So in StatementBlock1, this allows any resource full access to CloudTrail on the condition that their source IP address is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range. StatementBlock2. This allows full access to all RDS databases using all API calls except for that of the rds:DeleteDBInstance due to the NotAction parameter being used instead of the Action being used. And in StatementBlock3, this allows the creation and deletion of S3 Buckets within the cloudacademy bucket on S3.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at another example policy, this time, a resource-based policy, and in this instance, it’s from an S3 bucket. So in this policy, it allows the user, Stuart, as highlighted by the Principal parameter, to create and delete buckets in addition to deleting the bucket policy. Stuart can also delete and put objects within the bucket, and the bucket that this policy refers to is the bucket named ca-bucket-uk, as defined by the Resource parameter. However, there is a condition bound to this policy that states that Stuart can only do this if he was authenticated via Multi-Factor Authentication, MFA. That should now give you more of an understanding of how JSON IAM policies work and what they look like.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy"><a href="#Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Creating an AWS IAM Policy"></a>Creating an AWS IAM Policy</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I will show you how to create your IAM policies. Let’s start by creating an identity-based, customer managed policy, and there are a number of ways to create a customer managed policy, these being, copy an existing AWS Managed Policy. So we can copy an existing policy and then edit that policy to ensure it meets the requirements we need, and this can save us some time.</p>
<p>We can use the Policy Generator, and this allows you to create a customer managed policy by selecting options from a series of dropdown boxes. And we can also create our own policy. So if you’re proficient in JSON and the syntax of IAM policy writing, then you can write your own policies from scratch or paste in a JSON policy from another source. So I now want to give you a quick demonstration on how to create a policy in each of these three ways. And the demonstration will include, how to create a customer managed policy by editing an existing AWS managed policy, how to create a customer managed policy using the Policy Generator, and how to create a customer managed policy from scratch. So let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS Management Console, and I’m at the IAM dashboard, and I’ve gone into Policies. So from here, we can create a number of different IAM policies. And the first method I’m going to show you is how to copy and import an existing AWS managed policy to create your own, if you need to make a few changes to it. So let’s go ahead and do that now. So from here, we need to go across to Create Policy.</p>
<p>Now, from here, we have an option on the top right here called Import Managed Policy, and that’s what we want to do. I want to import an AWS managed policy and then make a couple of small changes to it. So if I select Import Managed Policy and then find the policy that I want to find. So let’s, for example, look at AmazonS3FullAccess, import that, and we can see here that it’s imported the data. And if we look at the JSON tab, we can actually see the JSON format of that policy, and from here, we can directly make changes.</p>
<p>So for this quick demonstration, I want to copy this existing policy, but instead of allowing any resource, I want to specify my own resource for this, which will mean instead of this policy being, allow full access to Amazon S3, it allow full access to a specific bucket on Amazon S3. So let me go ahead and make those changes now. So I’m gonna change the asterisks from Resource and put in my own specific ARN of a bucket. So now, I’ve changed the resource to my own ARN.</p>
<p>So now, all I need to do is click on Next, go to Tags, and I can add any optional tags if I want. I’m just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Go across to Review, and here I can give this new policy a name. So I can call it S3FullAccessToMyBucket. And description, this allows full S3 access to ca-bucket-uk. And it gives you a summary of the policy here. So we can see the service that it’s using, the access level, and also the resource. Once we’re happy with that, we can simply click on Create Policy. And we can see that that policy has now been created.</p>
<p>Now, if we have a look at that policy, just by clicking on it there, it’ll take us straight to it, and we can see the JSON version of the policy. So that’s a very quick and easy way if you want to save yourself some time by copying existing S3 managed policies that are already there. Now, I chose a fairly simple policy just for demonstration, but there are some quite complex policies that AWS already have that you might need to just tweak a few changes to so you can simply import those existing managed policies, make your changes, and then save it as a new customer managed policy.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s the first method covered. Now, next, I want to show you how to create a policy using something called the AWS Policy Generator. Now, if you simply go to Google and type in the AWS Policy Generator, then it’ll come up straight away, and you’ll be brought to a page like this. Now, the actual URL of this Policy Generator, if you’d prefer to type it in, is awspolicygen.s3.amazonasw.com&#x2F;policygen.html. So this is a Policy Generator, and it allows you to easily create different types of AWS policies.</p>
<p>So if we look at this drop down list here, we can create an SQS policy, an S3 bucket policy, which, as we know, is a resource-based policy, a VPC endpoint policy, an IAM policy, and an SNS topic policy. We’re interested in the IAM policy. So if we select that, now, in step two, we can add our statements. Now, here, we have our effect, which can be allow or deny. So let’s say allow for this example. And then, we can select the service that we’re interested in. Let’s select Amazon S3 to keep it nice and simple. And now, we can select our actions.</p>
<p>Now, we can select individual actions here just through these tick boxes for any actions that we’re interested in. So I’ll just select a number of different ones there. And you can see here that it’s selected five actions. If you wanted all actions, you would simply tick this box. And then, you’d put in the ARN of the bucket. So let’s just put in that same bucket that we used in the previous example. And then, here, we can also add in any conditions that we’d like. So just through a series of dropdown boxes, you can specify any conditions that you’d like in there as well. And then, once you’re happy with your policy, simply select Add Statement. And here, it breaks down a summary as well. So it shows the effect, the action, the actions that we selected, the resource, and if there’s any conditions, which we didn’t specify any.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to, we can now add an additional statement. So for example, if we wanted to add some RDS elements in here as well, we can select AWS Service, select a load of actions, put in the ARN of your RDS database, and also add that statement to the same policy. Then, once you’re happy with your policy and the number of statements that you’ve added, simply click Generate Policy. And here, it shows you the JSON view of the policy that you would need based on your dropdown selection. So what you can do now is simply copy that, go back to IAM, go to your policies, Create Policy, go to the JSON tab, and simply paste it in. So it’s a very quick way of creating a policy through a series of dropdown boxes. And again, you can just progress through, adding any tags that you need to do, give this a name, ThisIsMyPolicy, and then click Create Policy. And again, you can see that this has been created. You can select that. And again, we can see the JSON statement there.</p>
<p>So now, we’ve looked at how to create a policy by copying an existing AWS managed policy. We’ve looked at how to use the AWS Policy Generator. Now, let’s just quickly review how to create a policy from scratch. So again, go back to Policies and then Create Policy. Now, you can either use this visual editor or go straight to JSON, and you can start typing out your policy in here as and how you need it, or you can use the visual editor, which is very similar to the Policy Generator we just looked at, where, again, you can choose a service, then the specific actions, say all S3 actions, then you can specify the resources, whether you want this, again, as an access point, a bucket, a job, an object. So you can say any object. Then, you can specify any conditions, if you need MFA or specific source IP, for example. And again, you can also add additional permissions here.</p>
<p>So almost like another statement. It’s very similar to the Policy Generator. But for me, personally, I think the Policy Generator is slightly easier to understand. And then, once you have your settings as you want them, and this has all been pre-filled from the options from the visual editor, and, again, click Tags, then Review, and then give this a name, MyPolicy, and then go to Create Policy. And if we take a look at the policy, we can just see its details again. And again, this shows the JSON view, et cetera. And if we wanted to edit the policy directly here, then we can. Click on Edit. Then, we can either edit through the visual editor, or we can directly edit the JSON view as well. So that’s just a couple of ways of creating your IAM policies in a few very simple steps.</p>
<h1 id="Policy-Evaluation-Logic"><a href="#Policy-Evaluation-Logic" class="headerlink" title="Policy Evaluation Logic"></a>Policy Evaluation Logic</h1><p>Every time someone tries to access a resource within AWS, the request is processed through a series of steps. One of which involves evaluating the level of permissions based upon the policies that are used. So let’s take a look at the whole process to understand how access is either granted or denied. And we can start with a simple four step process. So firstly authentication. We must first ensure that the principle sending the request is authenticated as a valid user.</p>
<p>Next, the context. Once authentication of the principle has been established, AWS then needs to determine the context of the request that is being asked, for example, what service or action is being requested. And this ensures that the relevant policies can be highlighted based on the request. We then have policy evaluation, and this is the part that we are interested in. Based on the request, there may be multiple policy types that need to be reviewed to determine the level of access, and I shall cover this in greater detail as we go through this lecture. And then finally, the result. AWS will determine if access is allowed or denied based upon the evaluation of all policies used.</p>
<p>So for this lecture, I want to focus purely on the third point, the policy evaluation and how that process is carried out. The rules for reviewing permissions across multiple policies in a single account is actually quite simple and can be summarized like this: by default, all access to a resource is denied. Access will only be allowed if an Allow has been specified within a policy associated with the principle. If a single Deny exists within any policy associated with the same principle against the same resource then that Deny will overrule any previous Allow that might exist for the same resource and action. So to reiterate, an explicit Deny will always take precedence over an Allow.</p>
<p>Now, there is an order in which policies are evaluated, and the following list of policies are shown in the order of evaluation. So firstly, we have any Organizational Service Control Policies. Then any Resource-based policies, then IAM permission boundaries, and then finally Identity-based policies. So let’s look at an example scenario. Let’s assume that the user, Stuart, is requesting to upload an object to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk using the s3:PutObject API.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s assume we have the following policies in place to see what happens at each step of the evaluation. So firstly, the evaluation will review any organization SCPs in place, and here is our example SCP. So this SCP will simply deny all access to RDS. So there is no Deny in place that affects the s3:PutObject requested by Stuart so the evaluation continues. Next, the evaluation will identify any resource-based policies, and here we have a Bucket Policy associated with the ca-bucket-uk as shown.</p>
<p>Again, there is no Deny here for the request in question, so the evaluation continues. Next, we have IAM Permission Boundaries. And this IAM Permission Boundary Policy is set on the user, Stuart. So this policy sets out a maximum permission boundary of full access to s3. Remember, permission boundaries do not actually grant permissions, they set the maximum privilege level, as full access to s3 allowed, the evaluation continues.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the evaluation of any Identity-based Policies, and this policy is associated to the group that the user, Stuart, belongs to. So as we can see, this policy allows any s3 action to the ca-bucket-uk. As a result, this permits Stuart to upload an object using s3:PutObject to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk. So the final decision upon the policy evaluation is to allow the request.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Welcome to the final lecture of this course where I shall summarize the key points taken from the previous lectures. I began by looking at the different IAM policy types, and here I covered the following. And I started with Identity-based policies. These policies can be attached to Users, User Groups or Roles. They can be managed or inline policies. The managed policies can be AWS managed or customer managed. AWS managed policies are pre-configured by AWS and customer managed policies are created by us as customers. And inline policies are embedded directly into the entity, either the User, User Group or Role, creating a 1-2-1 relationship.</p>
<p>Then we have Resource-based policies. And these are policies associated with a resource instead of an identity. So, S3 bucket policies are a common resource-based policy. Trust relationship policies are also a resource-based policy and resource-based policies must have the ‘Principal’ parameter to determine which identity that the policy relates to. Permission boundaries. Permission boundaries can only be associated with a User or Role. They do not grant permissions, they act as a guardrail to limit the maximum level of permissions that the User or Role can be given. And the policy can be an AWS managed or customer managed policy. And then we have Organization Service Control Policies, SCPs. And these are used by AWS Organizations and attached to AWS accounts or Organizational Units, OUs, to define the maximum permissions allowed for the members of the associated account or OU. And they operate at the account level. SCPs do not grant access, they add a guardrail to define what is allowed. And don’t forget, you still need to configure your identity-based policies or resource-based policies.</p>
<p>To use SCPs you need to ensure that you deploy AWS Organizations using the enable all features setting. Next I looked at the JSON policy structure and broke down the different parameters of the policy which included the following. Version, this specifies the policy language version. Statement, this defines that main element of the policy. The Sid, the Statement ID, and this is an optional parameter that allows you to set a unique identifier within the Statement. Effect, this element can be set to either Allow or Deny.</p>
<p>The Principal, this parameter defines which principal the policy relates to. And the Principal is only used for resource-based policies. Action, this is the action that will either be allowed or denied. Resource, this element specifies the actual resource you wish the Action and Effect to be applied to. Condition, and this is an optional element that allows you to control when the permissions will be effective based upon set criteria. I then gave a demonstration showing you how to create different IAM policies using a variety of different methods. Then finally I broke down the process of how IAM evaluates permissions when multiple different types of policies are involved. And in this lecture we learnt that when a request to access a resource is triggered, AWS will ensure that the identity is authenticated, it will then determine the context of the request, at which point policy evaluation will take place before determining if the request is allowed or denied.</p>
<p>By default all access is to a resource is denied. Access will only be allowed if an Allow has been specified within a policy associated with the principal, and a Deny will overrule any previous Allow. IAM Policy types are evaluated in the following order. Organizational Service Control Policies, Resource-based Policies, IAM Permission Boundaries, and then finally, Identity-based Policies. That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of how you can use IAM Policies to define and manage permissions across your account. </p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this course where I shall be looking at how to control access to your resources using IAM User Groups and Roles when using the AWS Identity &amp; Access Management Service, commonly referred to as IAM. I shall be looking at some of the security best practices when using User Groups and Roles and how these can help you secure access to your resources more effectively.</p>
<p>My name is Stuart Scott, and I’m the AWS content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask me any questions using the details shown on the screen, alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> where one of our cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this course has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles: an AWS administrator, security engineer, security architect, and also anyone who’s looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS certification.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of when and why you should use User Groups and Roles within IAM and how they help you control access to resources. You will also learn which type of IAM role to use and when.</p>
<p>As an intermediate level course, you should already have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for, in addition to policy types such as managed, customer and in-line. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of it’s core services, but it is not essential.</p>

<h1 id="Managing-Multiple-Users-with-IAM-User-Groups"><a href="#Managing-Multiple-Users-with-IAM-User-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Managing Multiple Users with IAM User Groups"></a>Managing Multiple Users with IAM User Groups</h1><p>In this lecture, I want to talk about how IAM User Groups can be used to manage multiple users. IAM User Groups do not signify a single user and they can’t be referenced as a principal in any AWS access policy like a User or a Role can. However, they are used to authorize access for members of the group to AWS resources through the use of AWS Policies attached to the User Groups. So User Groups are objects that contain IAM Users, and these User Groups will have IAM policies associated that will allow or explicitly deny access to AWS resources.</p>
<p>These policies can be AWS Managed policies that can be selected from within IAM, customer-managed policies that are created by you, or in-line policies, which are written and embedded directly into the group. User Groups are a great user management feature and they are normally created to directly relate to a specific requirement or job role. For example, you could have a group called Developers, and then attach policies to that group that allow access to AWS resources required by your development team.</p>
<p>Any users that are then a member of that group will automatically inherit the permissions applied to the group. By applying permissions to a group instead of individual users, it makes it easy to modify permissions for multiple users at once, simplifying access management at scale. It’s a security best practice to apply permissions to User Groups and then associate users to that group than to associate policies to individual Users. This prevents you having to update permissions for each and every user.</p>
<p>For example, if you needed to change access for all the individual developers that had policies assigned to them directly, and this can be very time intensive and prone to human error, especially in an enterprise environment. If using groups and additional access is required for your Developer User Group, all you would need to do is to modify the permissions of the Developer Group and all your associated developers would inherit the new access.</p>
<p>Creating a group is very simple and is essentially a three-step process. You must give your group a meaningful name, add users to the group, attach permissions via the policies. Once you have created a user group, you can then review its configuration, edit the permissions and see other details such as the ARN of the user group. Let me show you via a quick demonstration on how to create an IAM group and then how to modify the permissions of the group once it’s been created.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS Management Console and I’ve gone to the IAM dashboard. Now, from here, to access and create groups, under access management on the left, you can see user groups. So if you select that, and then will show you any groups that you currently have. And I only have one group, which is Admin. So to create a new group, you’ve gotta cross to the right-hand side here, click on create group. And the first thing you need to do is to give the group a name. So I’m going to call this MyS3andEC2Group. And then after that, you need to select the users that you want to be a part of the group.</p>
<p>So if you already have the IAM users there, you can add them at this stage. So let’s just go ahead and add in Stuart. And then at the bottom, you can then attach any policies that you want to be associated with the group. So if I type in S3, and it’ll pick up any policies that we have associated with S3. And I’m going to select this one here, this AmazonS3andEC2FullAccess policy. And if I click on the little plus sign here, it’ll give you a JSON view of the actual policy itself. So you can see exactly what’s happening.</p>
<p>So now I’ve selected that policy. If we just go down to create group at the bottom, and it’s as simple as that. So it’s very easy to create a group. You simple give it a name, specify the users if you need to at that stage and also add any permissions if you want to at that stage as well.</p>
<p>Now, once we’ve created our group, if we select it, we can see the user list here. Now, if you need to add any additional users, simply click on add users, select the users that you’d like and click on add users. And then they’ll be immediately added to the group. You can also look at the permissions. So here’s the policy that we added. Now, we can if we want to, add additional permissions by clicking on this button here. And you can either attach an existing policy or create an inline policy that’s directly embedded into the group.</p>
<p>So for example, if we go to attach policies, and we want RDS access as well for the people in this group, have a quick search and we’ll select this AWS managed policy for RDSFullAccess. Click on add permissions. And we can now see that this group has two permissions policies. And again, we can view the JSON details of those policies if we want to. And then we have the Amazon RDS policy here. So it’s very easy to set up groups and only literally takes just a few clicks.</p>
<p>So that’s how you create a new group, add users and also change the permissions as well. And also, just before we finish, if you want to delete the group, you can click on delete here. And we just need to type in the name of the group to confirm the deletion. So I’ll just go ahead and do that. Then click on delete. And that deletes the group. Finally, from a limitation perspective, your AWS account has a default maximum limit of 300 groups. To increase this you’ll need to contact AWS using the appropriate limit increase forms. Also, a user can only be associated with 10 groups, so bear this in mind when assigning permissions and each group can contain 10 different policies attached at once. Limitations on AWS services is fluctuating all of the time, so for the latest information on Group limitations, please see the following URL here.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Roles"><a href="#IAM-Roles" class="headerlink" title="IAM Roles"></a>IAM Roles</h1><p>IAM Roles allow trusted Users, AWS services and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM credentials to access your AWS resources. Roles act as identities, much like Users do, and have permissions assigned to them defining what resources the Roles can and can’t access. Unlike Users though, which represent a single identity, IAM Roles are designed to be assumed by multiple different entities as and when required. Like I say, Roles are used for temporary access to gain access to resources, and each time the role is assumed by a User, an AWS service or an application, a new set of credentials is dynamically created for the duration of that session. As a result, Roles do not have any long term credentials associated, so there is no password for console access, nor are there any access keys for programmatic access that are explicitly associated with the Role.</p>
<p>For every role there will be associated policies controlling access as to what can and can’t be accessed when the role is assumed. There will also be a Trust Relationship, and this Trust Relationship defined who or what can assume the role, for example a User, an AWS account, or an AWS Service. IAM Roles are generally used: if you need to grant temporary access for Users to AWS resources that they don’t normally require access to or you can use a Role to grant access for an IAM user in one account to access resources in another AWS account or perhaps an AWS service needs to access resources on your behalf or if an application requires access to resources you can use a Role instead of embedding credentials into the software itself. Or you might have federated users who require access to specific resources, perhaps those authenticated via Active Directory So, as a result, Roles can be assumed by the following: A user that’s in the same AWS account as the where the role has been created, a user that’s in a different AWS account than where the the role has been created, an AWS service, such as EC2, or an external federated users to your AWS account</p>
<h1 id="Using-AWS-Service-Roles-to-Access-AWS-Resources-on-Your-Behalf"><a href="#Using-AWS-Service-Roles-to-Access-AWS-Resources-on-Your-Behalf" class="headerlink" title="Using AWS Service Roles to Access AWS Resources on Your Behalf"></a>Using AWS Service Roles to Access AWS Resources on Your Behalf</h1><p>An AWS Service Role allows an AWS service to assume a role to access other AWS resources within your own account on your behalf. This is commonly used for EC2 instances, whereby you could create a role for an EC2 instance to assume to gain access to AWS resources on your behalf. Let’s look at an example of when you might use this.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario. You have an EC2 instance running an application that requires access to Amazon S3 to Put and Get objects using the relevant API calls. To allow access to S3, a set of credentials could be stored on the EC2 instance within the application code allowing it to use those credentials to gain access to the relevant S3 Bucket for any Put or Get API requests. However, in this scenario, you would need to manage these credentials manually including the rotation of access keys, which is obviously an administrative burden and open to the possibility of being compromised by a malicious attacker.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue, the EC2 instance could be assigned an IAM Role, which in turn would have the relevant permissions associated granting the EC2 instance and its application to access S3 to perform the Put and Get API calls using existing AWS managed or customer manager policies. EC2 instances can be assigned a role during its creation, or to a running instance. You can also replace a role that is already associated with an EC2 instance with a new role. From a security best practice perspective you should always associate a Role to an EC2 instance for accessing AWS resources instead of storing local credentials on the instance itself.</p>
<p>There is also another great advantage of using Service Roles. Let’s now imagine we have a fleet of EC2 instances all using the same application and performing the same task using the same role, but now consider that your existing application, which was used to perform Put and Get requests is now only required to perform Put requests only, and Get requests must be denied.</p>
<p>To make the change, all you’d to do is to alter the permissions assigned to the IAM Role and all EC2 instances associated with that Role would now have the correct permissions. If this same scenario happened by embedding credentials locally on the EC2 instance, then it would take a long time to replicate the change on every instance accurately.</p>
<p>When creating a Service Role, there’s a number of AWS Services that integrate with IAM that support roles. This is a screenshot at the time of writing this course showing the supported AWS services, but for the latest information, you should always check the AWS documentation found here. Before we move on from AWS Service Roles, I want to mention service-linked roles.</p>
<p>A number of different AWS services require roles to perform functions requiring very specific permissions, and in these instances AWS allows you to create service-linked Roles. These are often created the first time that you use a service. Service-linked Roles come pre-configured with the relevant AWS Managed policies, trusts and permissions allowing only that Service to carry out the required operations with other AWS resources that it needs to interact with. Some examples of these roles include AWS ServiceRoleForAmazonSSM.</p>
<p>So AWS Systems Manager uses this IAM service role to manage AWS resources on your behalf. AWS ServiceRoleForCloudTrail. So this service linked role is used for supporting the organization trail feature with AWS CloudTrail. And AWS ServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents. CloudWatch uses this service-linked role to perform Amazon EC2 alarm actions.</p>
<p>So if we look closer at the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM in IAM, we will find that the trusted identity to use this role is ssm.amazonaws.com, AWS Systems Manager. and with it having an AWS Managed policy already configured, we’re unable to edit and update this policy. This policy is specifically designed to provide access to AWS Resources managed or used by Amazon SSM, and this role is created when you configure SSM. So the difference between AWS Service and AWS Service-Linked Roles is that AWS Service roles allow you to apply your own customer managed or AWS Managed policies, whereas service-linked roles come pre-configured with a specific set of read-only AWS managed policies that can only be used by that particular service.</p>
<h1 id="Using-IAM-User-Roles-to-Grant-Temporary-Access-for-Users"><a href="#Using-IAM-User-Roles-to-Grant-Temporary-Access-for-Users" class="headerlink" title="Using IAM User Roles to Grant Temporary Access for Users"></a>Using IAM User Roles to Grant Temporary Access for Users</h1><p>There might be circumstances where you will need to grant temporary access to AWS resources for a particular user and the best way to do this would be to allow the user to assume a role with these new permissions. The alternative would be to either add a policy associated with the user and then remember to remove the policy again afterwards, which would likely lead to a security risk, and as we know, attaching policies to a specific user isn’t considered a security best practice, we should use user groups instead. However, if we added these permissions to a user group that the user belonged to, then all users that are a part of that same user group would receive those permissions, so that’s definitely a security risk.</p>
<p>So in this instance, creating a new role with the relevant permissions and allowing only specific users to assume that role, is the best approach to the problem. When a user assumes a role, it replaces all other permissions that the user has. You might think that the user keeps their current permissions and just inherits the additional permissions set out by the role, but that’s not the case. When you assume a role, your existing permissions are temporarily replaced.</p>
<p>I mentioned previously that every role has a trust relationship and so as a user, you can only assume roles where they have been added as a trusted entity. However, in addition to being trusted, the user also has to have the relevant permissions to assume the role as well and this is done via an access policy.</p>
<p>So let’s assume we have a role called RoleS3FullAccess with a permission policy attached as shown which grants full access to Amazon S3. And the trusted entity of this role was defined as the user specified in this ARN. So this means this role trusts the user, Stuart, to assume the role to gain full access to S3. However, Stuart’s permissions do not currently allow him to assume this role. For Stuart to be able to assume the RoleS3FullAcess role, Stuart will need to have the following policy associated with his user, where the text in red is the ARN of the role. When this policy is associated with Stuart, he then has permission to assume the role which is trusted to him as defined in the trusted entity section of the role allowing him to have full access to S3.</p>
<p>Let me now provide a demonstration on how you could create this example that we just ran through. Okay, so I’m in my AWS Management Console and I’m at the IAM dashboard. So in this demonstration, we’re going to create a role with a policy attached and then add an inline policy to the user, Stuart, to ensure that Stuart can assume the role.</p>
<p>So firstly, let’s create our role. So on the left here, we have roles and then over in the top right, we have Create Role. So because we want this role to assumed by a user, we have to pick the correct type of trusted entity. So it’s not going to be assumed by an AWS Service and it’s not to with Federation either, so the option we need here, is this one relating to an AWS account. Now although says another AWS account, this option is used to creating cross-account access, but you can also create roles to be assumed by users within your own account as well. And to do that, all we need to do in the account ID, is to enter our our account ID, so if I just add that in there, and you can also add a couple of additional options, such as requiring multifactor authentication, et cetera.</p>
<p>So once we’ve put in the account ID of where the users are that we want to assume this role, we can then click on next, permissions. And I want the policy that’s attached to this role to have full S3 access, so let’s have a quick search. And here we have it here, Amazon S3 full access, which is an AWS managed policy. Then click on next for tags. Add any tags in that you’d like for the role as an optional step. I’m just gonna leave it blank for this demonstration. And this is where we can give the role a name, so I’m going to call this RoleS3FullAccess. Give it a description if you need to and here we have the trusted entity, which is my own account and then all we need to do from there, is click on Create Role.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we search for that. RoleS3, here we have our role here. So if we go into the role, we can have a look at our trust relationships, so this is essentially saying that anyone within this account is trusted to assume this role and we can also edit this trust relationship as well. So this shows the policy that relates to that trust relationship. So this essentially allows anyone in this account, access to the role, as long as they have that assume role permissions that we’ll be looking at in just a moment. But I want to make this a bit more secure, so I’m going to change it from root to user, Stuart.</p>
<p>So now the trusted relationship for this role will only allow the user, Stuart, within this account to assume the role, given the correct permissions. So I’m gonna update that trust policy and now we can see the trusted entity has been changed. And if we take a look at the permissions, we can see that it has the policy attached there as well. So now we’ve got roles set up with the correct permissions, we now need to edit the user, Stuart with an inline policy to allow that user to assume the role. So I’ve just gone with IAM user of Stuart. If we click on add inline policy and go across to JSON.</p>
<p>Now, here I’m just going to paste in a policy that I’ve already created. So will allow the user, Stuart to use the secure token service AssumeRole action against the role that we just created and that’s the ARN in the role. So now Stuart will have access to assume that role. Let’s go to review policy. Give this a name. I’m just going to call this, AssumeRoleS3. Create policy. And there we have the inline policy that we just created, attached to the user, Stuart.</p>
<p>So now what I want to do, is to log in as the user, Stuart and show you how I can switch to this role. Okay, so I’ve now signed in as the user, Stuart and to switch roles, all I need to do, is to select on the top right up there, select Switch Role. And again, Switch Role. Type in the account. So I’ll just paste that in quickly and then type the role name, which we called RoleS3FullAccess and then click on Switch Role. And that’s it, we’ve now switched roles and if you look in the top right, we can see that it says, RoleS3FullAccess at this account number and that signifies that you swapped your permissions for that role that the user, Stuart has just assumed.</p>
<p>Once you finish what you need to do with the permissions given by the role, you can simply select the top right area again and say Switch Back. And that will revert you back to your original user with your original permissions. IAM user roles are often used to create a cross-account access role, allowing users in one AWS account to access resources in a different AWS account. For a full explanation on how to create cross-account roles, please see our existing course found here.</p>
<h1 id="Using-Roles-for-Federated-Access"><a href="#Using-Roles-for-Federated-Access" class="headerlink" title="Using Roles for Federated Access"></a>Using Roles for Federated Access</h1><p>In this lecture, I want to discuss how users who have been federated can access your resources using roles. When doing so you have two options. Firstly, Web Identity, this allows users federated by a specified external web identity or OpenID Connect provider, to assume this Role to perform actions in your account. And secondly, SAML 2.0 federation, this allows users that are federated with SAML 2.0, to assume this Role to perform actions in your account.</p>
<p>So let’s first look at Web Identity and a scenario where you might need to create a Role. You’ve just created a new mobile application that requires access to Amazon S3 to store media such as photos and videos from users worldwide. As a part of the operations of your application, it will require permissions to S3, to upload and download this media from tens of thousands of users. Embedding long-term credentials into your application code to do this goes against all security best practices. And so instead, you should design your application to request temporary credentials from authenticated users through web identity federation. </p>
<p>Before I go any further, let me explain what identity federation is. It’s basically a method of authentication where two different providers can establish a level of trust, allowing users to authenticate from one, which authorizes them to access resources in the other. During the federation process, one party would act as an Identity Provider, known as an IdP, and the other would be the service provider, an SP. The identity provider authenticates the user and the service provider controls access to their service or resources based on the IdP’s authentication.</p>
<p>You’ve probably all been to websites where it presents you with a login page, where you can either login using existing credentials, native that service, or you might have an option to authenticate using credentials from a third party provider, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, or LinkedIn, et cetera. So going back to our example, our application run on AWS would be the service provider, and the Web Identity provider could be Google or Facebook, for example.</p>
<p>So when users authenticate to your app via web identity federation, they will receive an authentication token. This token is then exchanged for temporary security credentials in AWS, which can be mapped to your IAM Role, using the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API. This then allows the relevant access to Amazon S3 provided by the role, to carry out the operations needed by the application.</p>
<p>Generally, when working with mobile applications, the preferred and recommended method for managing access, would be via Amazon Cognito, to manage his federation process. For more information related to Amazon Cognito, please see our existing course here.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at SAML 2.0 federation. Whereas web identity federation is generally used for large, wide scale of access from unknown users, SAML 2.0 is generally used to authenticate your employees using existing directory services that you might already be using. SAML, which stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, is a standard that’s used to exchange authentication and authorization identities between different security domains, which uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a user between a SAML Identity Provider and a SAML consumer.</p>
<p>For example, you might already to be using Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate your employees to your internal network. And so you might not want to or need to create lots of users in IAM with their own set of credentials. Instead, it would be easier to allow them to federate their access through via SAML, integrating with your ADFS server. The benefits of this are twofold. It minimizes the amount of administration required within IAM and it allows for a single sign on solution.</p>
<p>As the vast majority of organizations today are using Microsoft Active Directory, using MSAD is an effective way of granting access to your AWS resources without going through the additional burden of creating potentially hundreds of IAM user accounts. Let’s take a high-level look at how active directory authentication mechanism is established. This example will assume the user within an organization requires API access to S3, EC2, and RDS. This scenario will also include the use of an AWS service called Security Token Service, STS. The Security Token Service allows you to gain temporary security credentials for federated users via IAM, associated with IAM roles and policies. Let’s look at this in more detail via a diagram.</p>
<p>A user within an internal organization initiates a request to authenticate against the Active Directory Federated Service, an ADFS server, via a web browser using a single sign on URL. If their authentication is successful by using their Active Directory credentials, SAML will then issue a successful authentication assertion back to the user’s client, requesting federated access. The SAML assertion is then sent to the AWS Security Token Service, to assume a role within IAM using the AssumeRoleWithSAML API. STS then responds to the user requesting federated access with temporary security credentials, with an assumed role and associated permissions, allowing S3, EC2, and RDS access as per our example, the user then has federated access to the necessary AWS services as per the role’s permissions.</p>
<p>This is a very simple overview of how federation is instigated from the user for API access to specific AWS services. Corporate identity federation is always authenticated internally first by Active Directory before AWS, when creating your role for users federating via SAML, you can specify if you want to provide programmatic access only, or programmatic and AWS management Console access, in addition to specific permissions to access other AWS resources.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture which will summarize some of the key points mentioned throughout the previous lectures. I started this course looking at User Groups and in this lecture we learnt that: IAM User Groups can be used to manage multiple users. They do not signify a single user and can’t be referenced within an IAM policy. They contain IAM Users and have IAM policies associated with them defining their permissions. They are normally created to directly relate to a specific requirement or job role. Applying these permissions to a Group instead of individual users is a security best practice.</p>
<p>To create a Group is very simple and is essentially a 3 step process: Give your Group a meaningful name. Add users to the Group. And then attach permissions via policies. There are limitations on the number of groups per AWS account and for the latest information on this please refer to the following url. I then focused on IAM Roles to understand how they can be used to help manage access. I started by explaining that IAM Roles: Allow trusted Users, AWS services and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM credentials to access your AWS resources. They are designed to be assumed by multiple different entities as and when required.</p>
<p>Each time a role is assumed a new set of dynamic credentials are created. IAM Roles do not have any long term credentials associated with them. Roles have associated policies controlling access as to what can and can’t be accessed when the role is assumed. A Trust Relationship defines who or what can assume the role. IAM Roles are generally used: To grant temporary access for Users in your account or cross-accounts. For AWS Services to carry out specific operations on your behalf. Or for federated uses. I then explained what AWS Service Roles were and what they were used for, and in this section I covered the following points: AWS Service Roles allows AWS services to assume a role to access other AWS resources within your account on your behalf.</p>
<p>Commonly used for EC2 instances. AWS managed and customer managed policies can be attached to Service Roles. Service Roles can be attached to an EC2 instance during its creation or when its running. It’s a security best practice to associate a Role to an EC2 instance for accessing AWS resources instead of storing local credentials on the instance itself. There are a number of AWS Services that integrate with IAM that support roles. Service-linked roles perform functions requiring very specific permissions which are often created the first time you use the service.</p>
<p>Service-linked Roles come pre-configured with the relevant AWS Managed policies, trusts and permissions allowing only that Service to carry out the required operations. The difference between AWS Service and AWS Service-Linked Roles is that AWS Service roles allow you to apply your own customer managed or AWS Managed policies, whereas service-linked roles come pre-configured with a specific set of read only AWS managed policies that can only be used by that particular service. Following Service Roles I then looked at IAM User Roles to understand how individual users can adopt a set of temporary credentials.</p>
<p>During this lecture I explained that: When a User assumes a Role it replaces all other permissions that the User has. To assume a role you need to be a trusted entity and have access to assume the Role via a policy. IAM User Roles are often used to create cross-account access, allowing users in one AWS Account to access resources in a different AWS account.</p>
<p>Finally I covered how Roles are used to grant access to federated users which involved both Web Identity federation and SAML 2.0 federation. When discussing Web Identity I explained that: Identity Federation is basically an access method of authentication where two different providers can establish a level of trust allowing users to authenticate from one, which authorizes them to access resources in another. AWS would act as a Service Provider.</p>
<p>A Web Identity Provider would be Google or Facebook, for example. When users authenticate via web identity federation, they will receive an authentication token. The token is then exchanged for temporary security credentials in AWS and mapped to a Role providing access. Amazon Cognito is the preferred method for managing federated access for mobile applications. When I covered SAML Federation I covered the following points: SAML 2.0 is generally used to authenticate your employees using existing directory services that you might already be using, such as MS AD. It minimizes the amount of administration required within IAM allowing for a single sign-on solution.</p>
<p>The Security Token Service allows you to gain temporary security credentials for federated users via IAM, associated with IAM roles and policies. That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of IAM User Groups and how they can be used to simplify access management across multiple users, and how IAM Roles provide short-term temporary credentials to your users and AWS Services.</p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this course where I shall be looking at how to manage your User identities when using the AWS Identity and Access Management Service, commonly referred to as IAM. I shall be looking at Users in depth, so if you are new to IAM and are looking to secure your resources through identity-based management then keep watching!</p>
<p>My name is Stuart Scott, and I am the AWS Content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen, alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this course has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles: an AWS Administrator, Security Engineer, Security Architect, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS Certification. By the end of this course you will have a greater understanding of Users within IAM, how to create, manage, and configure them using security best practices. As an intermediate course, you should already have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of it’s core services, but it is not essential.</p>

<h1 id="Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard"><a href="#Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="Overview of the User Dashboard"></a>Overview of the User Dashboard</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I’m going to review the dashboard of the user Console. In IAM, we can create user objects to represent an identity with long-term credentials, this could be a real person within your organization who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment, or it could be an account to be used by an application that may require permissions to access your AWS resources programmatically. Users are simply objects representing an identity which are used to authenticate to your AWS account with an associated set of permissions.</p>
<p>When you open the AWS IAM dashboard and select users, you will be presented with a screen similar to the following. This screen provides a summary of the key points of interest relating to your IAM users and it can quickly help you identify any potential security risks that you might encounter. As we can see, we have a number of different warnings on this screen in different colors. We have a green tick which symbolizes activity was measured within the last 90 days An amber exclamation mark showing activity was last measured between 91 and 365 days ago. And a red exclamation mark, which highlight anything older than 365 days ago. Anything either amber or red should be looked at and addressed as a priority to reduce potential security issues.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at this table and its columns to understand exactly what it’s trying to show you. The complete list of field names are shown here, and you can toggle them on an off as you need. Let me go through each of them one-by-one to explain what they represent. So username. This column is self-explanatory, it provides the username of that user.</p>
<p>Path. If you create your users using the IAM API or the AWS Command Line Interface, the CLI, then you can specify a path structure for your users. This is useful when you have a large organization and you want to define a management structure to help you organize your users more effectively.</p>
<p>For example, you could add a path for a user Stuart of &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Stuart. This would help to define where your users might be in accordance with your organization structure. In addition to this, you can also reference paths in your access policies, so for example you could allow all users in the &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F; path to have full access to S3 with a simple policy like this.</p>
<p>Groups. This shows the different groups that the user belongs to. In the screenshot, you can see that the user Stuart belongs to the Admin group. Last activity. This column is really useful to show the last time your users logged into the AWS Management Console or if they accessed any of your AWS resources programmatically using their access keys. As we can see from my example, the user Alice hasn’t accessed anything for 467 days, as a result I can say with some confidence that this user can be removed and deleted from IAM. So it’s a great way to ensure that you don’t have any unused user accounts, and deleting unused accounts is an IAM best practice.</p>
<p>MFA. MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, and so this will highlight any users that have been configured with MFA which adds an additional level of verification, enhancing security. The users in my example that show virtual mean that these users are using MFA on a virtual device, and in this example it’s the Google Authenticator app on a mobile phone. For those unfamiliar with MFA, let me give a brief explanation of what it is. Typically, when a user logs into the AWS Management Console, they will authenticate to your AWS account by providing their identification, typically their username, and then verify this identification, usually with a password. These two elements, the identification and verification, allow the user to authenticate. For many cases, the verification, the password, is sufficient enough to confirm the identity, the username. However, for users who have an elevated level of privileges, for example the users may have full access to a large number of AWS services, then you may want to, or be required to due to governance controls, implement an additional verification step within the authentication process. This adds another layer of security attached to the identity, and this is where Multi-Factor Authentication comes in, MFA. The name explains itself, it’s used to create an additional factor for authentication in addition to your existing methods, such as a password. Therefore creating a multi-factor level of authentication. So what is this additional level of security that MFA brings with AWS? MFA utilizes a random six-digit number that is only available for a very short time period before the number changes again which is generated by an MFA device. There is no additional charge for this level of authentication, however, you will need your own MFA device, which can be a physical token or a virtual device. AWS provides a summary of all supported devices here. Personally, I use Google Authenticator on my phone because it is simple and easy to set up and configure. Password age. This shows how long ago it was until the password of the user was changed. As a security best practice, your passwords should be changed regularly.</p>
<p>Console last sign-in. This column simply shows the last time a user signed in to the management console.</p>
<p>Access key ID. The access key ID will identify if it’s active or inactive and will display the key in use. Before I continue, let me just quickly explain a little more about Access Keys. Access Keys are used for programmatic access to your AWS resources, and they are comprised of two elements. An access key ID and a Secret Access Key ID The Access Key ID is made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters, such as the one shown here. The Secret Access Key ID is made up of 40 random upper and lowercase alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters, such as the one displayed on the screen. During the creation of a user who requires programmatic access, you are prompted to download and save these details and it’ll only be displayed once, and if you lose it, then you will have to delete the associated Access Key ID and recreate new keys for the user. It’s not possible to retrieve lost Secret Access Key IDs as AWS does not retain copies. These access keys must then be applied and associated with the application that you are using that requires the relevant access. For example, if you were using the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, you would first have to instruct the AWS CLI to use these Access Keys to authenticate you providing authorization. The method of performing this association varies based on the application and system that you are using. However, once this association has taken place it ensures that all API requests made to AWS are signed with this digital signature.</p>
<p>Active key age. The active key age refers to the age of the access keys that are associated with the user which, as I explained, are required for programmatic access. Access key last used. This column just shows the last time that the user used their Access Keys within your AWS account. As a security best practice, it’s a good idea to remove any access keys that haven’t been used for quite some time. This removes possible entry points for malicious users to gain access to your environment.</p>
<p>The ARN. The ARN, or Amazon Resource Name provides the unique identifier for referencing that particular user. For example, the one showne here for the user Stuart. Creation time. This is a simple time metric to show you how long ago the user was created Console access. The console access helps you to determine which users have access to the Management console. When creating a new user, you have the option to configure their access type as seen here. Each user can be configured to have Programmatic Access, or AWS Management Console Access, or both. If they have access to the Console, then this column will show as Enabled for the user and Disabled if the user does not have console access.</p>
<p>Signing certs. Finally, the last column of signing certs will show if the user has a Signing Certificate or X.509 Certificate associated with them for secure access to certain AWS product interfaces. For example, EC2 uses a Signing Certificate for access to its SOAP, Simple Object Access Protocol, and command line utilities. Finally, before we finish this lecture, you can also create and delete users as required, and search for any of your users via their username or access key from within the user dashboard.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-IAM-Users"><a href="#Creating-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Creating IAM Users"></a>Creating IAM Users</h1><p>When creating a new user, you have the option to create it via the AWS Management Console or programmatically via the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or using the IAM HTTP API. For this lecture, I should be using the AWS Management Console to demonstrate how to configure Users. User object creation is a simple process. Firstly, you will set the user details by creating a username, which can be up to 64 characters in length. Next you’ll select the AWS access type, either AWS Management Console access or programmatic access.</p>
<p>For programmatic access, an access key ID and secret access key ID will be issued to be used with the AWS CLI, SDKs or other development tools. If console access is required, you will need to define a console password for the user. Permission assignment through the use of policies can be attached to the user or inherited from a group that the user can be assigned to. And permission boundaries can also be applied to the user, controlling their maximum permission level. You can assign any tags to the user as you would with any other AWS resource. And then you must review and confirm the information that has been submitted before you create the user.</p>
<p>Once the user is created, you can download the security credentials via a CSV file. And that will contain the username, access keys required for programmatic access and the console login link. So let me now jump into the console to demonstrate how to create a new user. Okay, so I’ve just logged into my AWS Management Console. And the first thing I want to do is to go to IAM. And that can be found under the Security, Identity and Compliance category.</p>
<p>So if we select IAM, and that will take us straight to the IAM dashboard. And this is where we can start creating our users and groups and roles, et cetera, and anything else that we need to manage within IAM. So to create a new user, I need to go across to Users on the left here. And then from here, I can select Add users.</p>
<p>Now the first thing I need to do is to create the username of the user. So I’m going to call this user Patricia. And then we can select the access types. So we have the programmatic access here, all the AWS Management Console access here. So for this user, let me add both. So I want them to have programmatic access and also AWS Management Console access. So I’m going to select both. So for the AWS Management Console access, we need to enable a password so we can either have IAM auto-generated password or I can select my own. And for this demonstration, I’m going to add in my own password.</p>
<p>Now if you tick this option here, when the user signs in, they will be asked to generate their own password once they’ve used your initial password to login. And that’s a great idea, just to enhance security there. So if we click on Next, then we can assign permissions. And here we have a couple of options so we can add the user to an existing group. We can copy permissions from another user or attach existing policies directly to the user. So for best practice, I’m just going to add this user to a couple of different groups. So I’m gonna add them to the CloudAcademy group, and also to the RDSFullAccess.</p>
<p>So once you’ve selected the groups that you want the user to have, you can click on Next to go to tags. And this is an optional step. You can add any key value tags here for that user if you want to. Just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Then if we go to Next to Review, then we can review all the options that we’ve set. So we’ve given the username. We specify the access types. So you’ve got programmatic and AWS Management Console access. We’ve not set any permission boundaries. We’ve added the groups that we want the user to belong to and we haven’t applied any tags.</p>
<p>So now, we can go to Create User. Now we’ve successfully created the IAM user, but because we specified that we wanted programmatic access, we need to copy the access key ID and also the secret access key ID as well. If we download the CSV file of that user and take a look at that, we can see here that this CSV file shows the access key ID and also the secret access key ID, and also the console link as well to allow that user to login. So if we go back to the AWS Console, we can also email those login instructions to the user as well if we need to. Once you’ve taken a copy of the access key ID and the secret access key, then you can close this window. Remember, you will only be given one opportunity to take these details and download the CSV that contains that information, so make sure you do that. Then click on Close. And we can now see that that user, Patricia, has been set up as a user with the CloudAcademy and RDSFullAccess groups. So it’s very simple. It’s very quick. It’s very easy to set up a new user within IAM.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-IAM-Users"><a href="#Managing-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Managing IAM Users"></a>Managing IAM Users</h1><p>Once you have created IAM users, you can view their details to configure additional security options or review permissions and change access. In this lecture, I want to cover these additional features. This will be easiest to explain via a demonstration, and I can explain each point as we go through, so let’s take a look. So in this demonstration, I just want to select a user and just to show you some of the different elements that you can change of that user once it has been created, so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>So I’m in the Identity and Access Management Dashboard at the moment and you can see I’m in the Users section. So let’s take a look at this user, Patricia. So if I select the user and we can have a look at some of the options that we can see about this user and some of the things that we can change, et cetera. So this is a summary screen of the user. We have the users ARN at the top here, and we can also see the creation time of that user. And then we have a number of different tabs.</p>
<p>So start with the permissions tab. We can see that this user is getting permissions from two policies at the moment here, the Amazon S3 Full Access policy, and also the Amazon RDS Full Access. And if we wanted to, we can just take a quick look at these groups. We can have a look at the policy summary, or we can take a look at the JSON as well. So that’s the policy and the JSON format. And then if we look at the policy summary, we can see here that this allows full access to S3 and S3 Object Lambda. Here we can set her permissions boundary. Currently there’s not one set, but if we wanted to, we can set one to control the maximum permissions that this user can have. And also there’s a feature here to generate policy based on CloudTrail events.</p>
<p>So what this will do, it will generate a policy looking at the user’s activity. And then based on what the user has been accessing, it can generate a policy based on what services this user has been accessing. Also at the top here, we can add an inline policy for this user. So if we’d done that, then that will be a policy that is embedded within the user object itself. So it’s not taken from a role, it’s not taken from a group. The policy is attached within the user.</p>
<p>Okay, if we take a look at the groups, we can just see a quick breakdown of any groups that the user belongs to, and the policies that are attached to them, which we covered just a moment ago in the summary. The tags is what you’d expect. If there’s any tags here for the user, then they would be listed, or if you wanted to add any tags, then you can do so here. So for example, we can add a key of location and say, UK, Save Changes. And then we can see this tag for this user. Under security credentials, we could see console link that this user can use and we can manage the user’s password. And if we want to change the password, we can simply click on manage, and we can either disable the console access or generate a new password, or ask the user to create a new password at the next sign-in. We also have here, the assigned MFA device, the multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s not assigned, but we can go ahead and set up MFA for this user. So let’s go ahead and do that quickly. So if we click on manage, we have a couple of options here, virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or another hardware MFA device. For this, I’m just going to use a virtual MFA device and I’ll use the Google Authenticator app on my phone to do this. If I click on continue. So, first of all, you need to make sure you have an app on your mobile phone or your computer. Like I say, I’m going to use the Google Authenticator app on my phone.</p>
<p>So what I need to do is to show the QR code, and now on my phone, I’m going to add this as a new entry in my Google Authenticator app, so I’m going to click on Scan QR code. And then we can see at the bottom there is added the user, Patricia. And then we add in that code, so 074720. And then what we need to do is to add the second code that comes in when it appears on the Google Authenticator app. So we’re just waiting for that to come around and then I can add in the second code and then it’ll be synchronized and configured. So, we can see it’s about to change, and now I can add in the next code 185887, and then I click on Assign MFA. And that’s it, so you have successfully assigned a virtual MFA device to that user. Click on Close, and there we can see here that there’s an assigned MFI device. We can see that this user also had programmatic access ‘cause there’s access keys that have been generated.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to, we can make this access key ID inactive. So if wanted to do that, simply click on Make inactive. And it’ll explained that once you’ve done this, you can’t then use these keys to form any programmatic access. Click on deactivate. And you can see here, the status is now inactive. So any access keys that were used before for this user will no longer be allowed to make any kind of requests. If we wanted to generate new access keys, simply click on Create access key. And again, you’ll have a new access key ID and a new secret access key. And if you wanted to, you can download the CSV file, so you don’t forget those keys. Click on Close.</p>
<p>Now, if we go back up to the top to Access Advisor, I just wanted to show you this quickly. So what this does, it will basically show you which services that this user can access based on their current permissions, and also the last time that these services were accessed. So if you scroll down here, we can see that this user has access to a whole different range of services. And it’ll show you which policies are actually granting these permissions.</p>
<p>So this access to EC2 in IAM is being granted through the RDS Full Access policy, and access to S3 is being granted through the Amazon S3 Full Access. So this is great to review to identify if there’s any users there that do have access to services that they probably shouldn’t do. So you can then modify the policies accordingly just to make sure that the users are only accessing what they are supposed to access. So that was a very quick demonstration of some of the key points that you can change within a user’s properties once you have created an IAM user.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>This course covered all things related to IAM users, from the user dashboard, to the creation and management of users. AWS IAM is one of those services that you need to become very familiar with as it’s a fundamental part of your security process and ties in with any security governance controls that you might need to adhere to, whether they are either internal or external. Having a solid grasp of how to manage your users in IAM will help prevent you from having unnecessary security risks and exposures within your environment.</p>
<p>IAM user management is key to maintaining secure access controls at both the programmatic and console level. You should ensure you are regularly reviewing the following. The groups that are associated with your users to ensure those user still need access to those groups. You should monitor the Last Activity to identify any users who could potentially be removed and deleted from IAM. Implement multi-factor authentication, especially for any users who have an elevated level of permission.</p>
<p>Rotate and change passwords regularly. Remove console access for those users who have not signed into it for an extended period of time. Rotate access keys on a regular basis. And remove programmatic access for users who have not used their Access Key for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of IAM users and how to create, manage and review them to maintain a secure environment. Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. Thank you for your time and good luck with your continued learning of cloud computing. Thank you.</p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this course where I shall be providing an overview of the AWS Identity &amp; Access Management Service, commonly referred to as IAM, along with its core features. This is a key security service within AWS and is likely to be one of the first security services you will use and come across allowing you to manage specific access controls within your environment for your users.</p>
<p>My name is Stuart Scott, and I am the AWS content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen, alternatively you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this courses has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Administrators</li>
<li>Security Engineers</li>
<li>Security Architects</li>
<li>And anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS certification</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of AWS IAM, its features, and how it is used to help you manage and control access to your AWS resources. Although this is a beginner’s course, it would be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of its core services, but it is not essential.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Identity-and-Access-Management"><a href="#What-is-Identity-and-Access-Management" class="headerlink" title="What is Identity and Access Management?"></a>What is Identity and Access Management?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I shall provide an overview of what the Identity &amp; Access Management service is, and what IAM actually means.</p>
<p>Firstly I want to define what is meant by Identity &amp; Access Management and I shall break this down into two parts, starting with Identity Management. </p>
<p>Identities, such as AWS usernames are required to authenticate you to your AWS account, and this authentication process is managed in 2 stages.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first part of this process is to define who you are, effectively presenting your identity, so for example your AWS username. This identification is a unique value within IAM for your account, so this means IAM would prevent you from having 2 identical user accounts with the same name within the same AWS account.</li>
<li>The second part of the authentication process is to verify that you are who you say you are. This is achieved by supplying additional data, and when using our AWS usernames we can verify this by supplying a password</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Access Management relates to authorization and access control. Authorization determines what an identity can access within your AWS account once it’s been authenticated to it. An example of this authorization would be the user’s list of permissions to access specific AWS resources, for example, they might have Full Access to EC2 or Read Only to RDS.</p>
<p>Access Control can be classed as the mechanism of accessing a secured resource. For example, using the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username and password (Authentication and Verification)</li>
<li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA, used as an additional verification step following a valid password)</li>
<li>Or Federated Access, which allows users external to AWS to access resources securely without having to supply AWS user credentials from a valid IAM user account. Instead, these credentials are supplied from identity providers. For more information on Identity Federation, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-aws-identity-federation-simplify-access-scale-1549/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-aws-identity-federation-simplify-access-scale-1549/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So essentially IAM can be defined by its ability to manage, control, and govern authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms of identities to your resources within your AWS Account.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of the different security controls from an authentication and authorization perspective can help you design the correct level of security for your infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Features"><a href="#IAM-Features" class="headerlink" title="IAM Features"></a>IAM Features</h1><p>It’s critical to understand how IAM works and what can be achieved via the service, but it’s even more important to know how to implement its features. Without IAM, there would be no way of maintaining security or control of who or what could access your resources and what they could do with them, both internally and externally. IAM provides the components to maintain this management of access, but it is only as strong and secure as you configure it. </p>
<p>The responsibility of implementing secure, robust, and tight security within your AWS account using IAM is yours, you are the owner of the AWS account. You must define how secure your access control procedures must be, how much you want to restrict users from accessing certain resources, how complex a password policy must be, and if users should be using Multi-factor authentication. All of this is and much more is down to you to architect and implement, and much of it will likely depend on your own security standards and policies within your Information Security Management System (ISMS).</p>
<p>In this lecture, I want to talk about some of the different features and components that AWS IAM uses to centrally manage and control security permissions for any identity requiring access to your AWS Account and its resources. </p>
<p>From with the AWS Management Console, the IAM service can be found under the ‘Security, Identity &amp; Compliance’ category, and when accessed it will take you to the IAM Dashboard. </p>
<p>The initial dashboard of the IAM Console will display the following information.</p>
<p>This is a URL link that you can send to users who you will need to gain access to your AWS Management Console. This sign-in link can be customized by clicking on the ‘customize’ button to make it easier to remember and read. If you have multiple AWS accounts, this customization would help to distinguish between your accounts</p>
<p>IAM Resources. This section provides a summary overview of your IAM resources using a simple count of the number of users, user groups, roles, customer-managed policies, and identity providers you have configured within IAM. </p>
<p>Best Practices. This is populated with a list of IAM security best practices that AWS recommends you implement with links on how to implement them. I strongly recommend you try to adopt these best practices at your earliest opportunity. Maintaining tight security is paramount with working within a cloud environment.</p>
<p>In addition to this dashboard, you will also see 2 categories on the left menu, Access Management and Access Reports each listing a number of components underneath. I want to start by reviewing each of these components under Access Management to give you an insight into what each are used for, starting with Users.</p>
<p>User objects are created to represent an identity, this could be a real person within your organization who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment, or it could be an identity that is used by an application to interact with your AWS resources programmatically.  Users are simply objects representing an identity which are used in the authentication process to your AWS account. Being unique values, every user has an Amazon Resource Name, an ARN which it can be referenced by. An example of a user’s ARN could be as shown.</p>
<p>When configuring your Users you can set them up for Multi-Factor Authentication. Configuring MFA allows for an additional level of verification to be applied, the user will have to enter a random 6 digit number from a linked MFA device after their usual password. MFA should be used for the AWS Account owner and any other users who have elevated privileges. </p>
<p>IAM USer Groups are objects much like user objects, however, they are not used in any authentication process, instead, they are used to authorize members of the group access to AWS resources.</p>
<p>So, the IAM USer Groups contain IAM Users, and these groups have IAM policies associated that will either allow or explicitly deny access to AWS resources. These policies are either pre-existing AWS Managed policies, customer-managed policies that are created by you, the customer, or in-line policies which are embedded explicitly to the group itself.</p>
<p>IAM Roles allow Users, other AWS services, and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM permissions to access AWS resources. Roles essentially operate the same as User objects do in that it’s an identity with associated permissions to allow it access to different resources. The difference being however is that roles don’t define a single person, they are designed to be assumed by any identity or service that needs to temporarily acquire a set of permissions. Additionally, roles don’t have passwords associated with their identities, instead, like I just mentioned, roles are assumed as long as you have the correct permissions to assume it.</p>
<p>Policies used within IAM are written as JSON documents and these define what can and can’t be accessed. These policies can be attached to Users, User Groups, or Roles. </p>
<p>When working with policies, you can use Managed policies or In-line policies. Managed policies are viewed as a library of usable policies and come in 2 different flavors which can be applied to multiple Users, User Groups, and Roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS Managed Policies: These are a list of predefined policies granting varied access to different AWS services</li>
<li>Customer Managed Policies: These are policies created and written by you as the customer</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike Managed policies, Inline policies are not stored in a library, instead, they have to be written and explicitly embedded within a User, User Group, or Role, as a result, the same policy can’t easily be applied to another identity like Managed policies can.</p>
<p>If you are looking to provide federated access to your AWS resources, then you must add an identity provider. </p>
<p>Federated Access allows credentials external to AWS to be used as a means of authentication to your AWS resources. For example, you could establish a trust between your Active Directory Federation server on premises and your AWS account. Or, you could establish a trust between your AWS account and Google account. Either way, in these instances your ADFS server or Google account could be configured as Identity Providers allowing those authenticated by Active Directory or Google to access your resources in your AWS account. This prevents you from having to create individual IAM user accounts.</p>
<p>Under Account Settings, you can enforce a password policy, and it’s always best practice to do so. The Password policy should be used to enforce the minimum security requirements that need to be met for any password standards that your organization might have to adhere to. The password policy applies to all IAM users within your account, and as you can see here, you can be very specific by enabling&#x2F;disabling and configuring different controls.</p>
<p>The STS service is used to allow you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for both IAM users and federated users. The STS endpoints provide a list of Regions that are either activated or deactivated for STS. By default, all Regions are activated, however, it is recommended you deactivate the regions you do not intend to use. </p>
<p>By default STS uses the global endpoint of  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sts.amazonaws.com/">https://sts.amazonaws.com</a>, however, when using regional endpoints it can help to reduce latency.</p>
<p>So that has given a quick overview of the component covered by Access Management, I now want to look at the features that come under the category of Access Reports, starting with Access Analyzer</p>
<p>Access Analyzer. This is used to generate findings when a policy on a resource within your zone of trust allows access from outside your zone of trust. So this could be from a number of different sources, such as an IAM role allowing cross-account access, or a Bucket that allows a different account to upload objects into the bucket, basically any resource that allows external access to your resources will be flagged and highlighted to ensure you are aware of the access. This is a great tool to help reduce security risks and threats as you or your team may have unintentionally allowed access to a resource you shouldn’t have. Any issues are recorded by Access Analyzer as a finding allowing you to review the access </p>
<p>The credential report is a great tool that allows you to generate and download a *.csv file containing a list of all of your IAM users and their credentials. This provides a quick and easy way to review your accounts and the last time they were used, in addition to identifying when a user’s password was last changed and if they have Multi-Factor Authentication enabled.</p>
<p>If using AWS Organizations, it allows you to Select an organizational unit (OU) or account to view its service activity over the previous 365 days. By drilling down into the accounts in this section you can see which users have had activity, in addition to which AWS services they have accessed over a given time frame. </p>
<p>Service Control Policies. This links in with the previous component, ‘Organization Activity’, and lists any Service Control Policies that are applicable to the account and the number of identities affected. Service Control Policies, or SCPs, are different from identity-based policies which grant permissions to users, user groups, and roles as SCPs do not actually grant permission themselves. Instead, SCPs are used with AWS Organizations to implement and set a boundary of permissions for AWS accounts. </p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS, and EC2 via an identity-based policy in IAM. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2, despite having full access to S3. The SCP would prevent that service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>This course covered some of the fundamental concepts of AWS IAM, it was designed to give you an insight into the service providing an explanation of what it is and what it’s used for, in addition to the core features that IAM provides to help you secure your AWS environment and it’s resources. </p>
<p>I started by explaining what is actually meant by identity and access management and the difference between authentication, authorization, and access controls. I then focused on the components of IAM which allow you to manage and implement security controls and these included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>User Groups</li>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>Policies</li>
<li>Identity Providers</li>
<li>Password Policies</li>
<li>Security Token Service Endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>I then gave a quick review of some of the reporting features that IAM offers, which covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access Analyzer</li>
<li>Credential Report</li>
<li>Organization Activity</li>
<li>Service Control Policies</li>
</ul>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of how IAM is used to securely manage access to your resources.</p>
