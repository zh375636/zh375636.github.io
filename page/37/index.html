<h1 id="Using-Google-Cloud-SDK"><a href="#Using-Google-Cloud-SDK" class="headerlink" title="Using Google Cloud SDK"></a>Using Google Cloud SDK</h1><p>The Google Cloud Console provides you an easy way to manage your account and make changes. However, this is not your only option. The Cloud Software Development Kit (or Cloud SDK) allows you to interact with your GCP account by running commands in a terminal. You can accomplish tasks that would otherwise take you multiple steps with just one command. Also, you can use the Cloud SDK to create custom scripts or programs to automate repeatable tasks such as deployments.</p>
<p>Before I cover installation and set up, let me first show what you can do with the Cloud SDK by using Cloud Shell. Cloud Shell is an online terminal built right into the console. It already has the Cloud SDK preinstalled and preconfigured. So if you have a GCP account, you can jump right in and start using it.</p>
<p>To access the Cloud Shell, login to the GCP console, and then click the icon in the top right part of the page labeled “Activate Cloud Shell”. It might take a little while to load if you are opening it up for the first time. To make things easier for you to see, let me open the Cloud Shell in it’s own tab, by clicking here.</p>
<p>The Cloud SDK provides several commands that allow you to interact with various services. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first one is called GCLOUD</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>This is the main utility for performing common cloud tasks, including:</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Installing and upgrading components</li>
<li>Spinning up Compute Engine instances</li>
<li>Deploying apps to App Engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The second one is called GSUTIL</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>GSUTIL stands for “Google Storage Utility”</li>
<li>This is used for interacting with Google Storage such as managing Cloud Storage buckets and objects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>And the third is simply called BQ</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>This is used for interacting with BigQuery, so you would use it for things like running queries and manipulating datasets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let me show you a few examples of what you can do with the SDK.</p>
<p>First, you can use it to get basic information about your account. If you type “gcloud projects list” , you can list out all your current projects. You can use “gcloud projects get-aim-policy” to find all the IAM users for a specific project</p>
<p>The SDK can do a lot more than just pull information. You can also use it to provision new resources. If you want to create a new Compute Engine instance by using the console, you will need to navigate to the correct screen. And then fill out a long form like this. You would enter a name, select a region, pick a machine type, and a bunch of other settings. Now this is fine if you only need to do this occasionally. But what if you need to start up many VMs per day? Or what if you need to be able to create a script to start up VMs for you? </p>
<p>For that, you will need the Command line equivalent. Which you can actually get if you click on the button labeled “command line” at the bottom of the screen here. This will take all the settings you selected and generate the equivalent terminal command. Now you can copy and paste this into the terminal. Or you could use it to create a script or just save it for later. You also can easily modify any of these options, if you want something a little different. Like changing the boot disk size to 50 GB instead of 10. The gcloud command can create Compute Engine instances, GKE clusters, firewall rules, and much, much more.</p>
<p>One of the problems with using the command line is that you often have to pass in a lot of options. This gets repetitive if you tend to work on the same project. So it also provides a way to set certain values such as the default project and default zone.</p>
<p>And because you might need to work on multiple projects, you can even create multiple configurations and switch between them. So you can create one config for one project like this. And then another configuration for your second project.</p>
<p>You can see that I now have two new configurations. I can select the configuration I want, and then set the project and zone for that config. I could also switch to the second config and set a different project and zone. There are other settings you add as well. But this makes it easy for you to work on multiple projects without having to manually enter the same values over and over again. It will also help you from getting confused and deploying resources for a project into the wrong region or zone.</p>
<p>This was just a small taste of what the SDK can do. For a full list of options, refer to the following URLs:</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="Installing-the-Cloud-SDK"><a href="#Installing-the-Cloud-SDK" class="headerlink" title="Installing the Cloud SDK"></a>Installing the Cloud SDK</h1><p>The integrated Cloud Shell in the console is really handy. But there will be times when it will be more convenient to have the SDK installed on a development or production machine. In this lesson, I am going to show you how to do just that.</p>
<p>You can find detailed installation instructions at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install</a>. The actual steps will depend upon your operating system. The normal installation method is to download an installer, run it, and then follow the prompts. For some operating systems, there are alternative ways to install the SDK as well. You should pick the method that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>For this example, I will be following the instructions for Linux. </p>
<p>Next, you will want to verify that the installation was successful. You should be able to run “gcloud help” at the command prompt. If you get an error message, or if it says it could not find the command, then the SDK was not installed properly. You will need to refer back to the installation instructions, and figure out how to fix the issue.</p>
<p>If you get the help screen for the gcloud command, then you are ready to proceed. Next, run “gcloud init” to begin the setup process to authorize access to your account.</p>
<p>When asked if you would like to log in, type “Y” for yes. You will need to open the provided URL in a browser and sign in with Google. Then you will need to choose the account to log in with. Allow the Cloud SDK to manage GCP by clicking the “Allow” button. You will then be given a verification code that you need to copy and paste back in the terminal. Now pick a default project to use. You don’t need to set a default region or zone if you don’t wish to.</p>
<p>If you are behind a proxy, you might also need to perform a few extra steps to access GCP. Make sure to get your proxy settings from your network administrator, then follow the instructions here at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/proxy-settings">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/proxy-settings</a>.</p>
<p>At this point the SDK should be installed and working properly. But before I end this lesson, I want to show you a couple more things that will help you in the future.</p>
<p>The SDK installs some components by default, but it also has optional components as well. You can enter “gcloud components list” to get a list of all components. You can also see which have been installed and which are available for install. For example, if you are going to be developing Java applications, you may want to install the Google App Engine Java component by entering: “gcloud components install app-engine-java”.</p>
<p>New components usually have dependencies, and so those will need to be installed first. Accept the dependencies by typing “Y”. Then you will just need to wait for installation to complete. Later, if you no longer have any use for a component, you can also use the “components remove” command to delete it.</p>
<p>Over time, all components will receive updates. To download and install these updates, you need to run the “components update” command. This command will go through all of your installed components and update any that have a newer version. It’s a good idea to run this command on a regular basis to ensure you have the latest features and fixes.</p>
<p>So now you should have enough knowledge to install and set up the SDK on your own computer. Remember to check out the online command references for “gcloud”, “gsutil” and maybe even “bq”. Don’t be afraid to experiment and get familiar with the various options.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about installing and using the Google Cloud SDK. </p>
<p>I recommend you start with Cloud Shell first and get comfortable with the most common commands. Once you start building real systems, you will most likely want to install the SDK onto your local development environment. You may also want to install it on other machines to help automate deployments and service configuration. In either case, the SDK includes a lot of useful features to help you get the most out of your Google Cloud Platform account. While the console might be easier to use at first, the SDK can give you more options and can be faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>Well, that is all I have for you today. Remember to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching, and make sure to check out our many other courses at Cloud Academy!</p>

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><h1 id="Creating-Projects"><a href="#Creating-Projects" class="headerlink" title="Creating Projects"></a>Creating Projects</h1><p>Before you can start building anything on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, you first need a project. Projects allow you to easily organize all the resources in your account. Every time you create a compute, storage or network resource, you will need to assign it to a project. Projects also contain their own unique set of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a>, APIs, and billing account information.</p>
<p>So let’s say you wanted to build a blog for sharing photos. You would start out by creating a new project. Let’s say you named it “Photo blog”. You then would start adding some resources to it. First, you might add a Compute Engine instance for running WordPress. Then a Cloud SQL database for storing your posts. And finally a Cloud Storage bucket for hosting the photos. All three of these resources would be linked to the project “Photo blog”. Other projects would be set up in a similar fashion. In this way, you can easily tell which of your resources belong to “Photo blog” and which belong to other projects.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out, creating projects might feel like an unnecessary step. However, the value quickly becomes apparent as you start building more and more. Organizing your resources into projects means that you won’t have to scroll through a thousand Virtual Machines to find the one you are looking for. Also, it means that you won’t accidentally get a production database confused with a development database. Finally, it will make your life easier when you need to shut down a project. You won’t have to track down each individual resource and manually delete it. When you delete a project, all associated resources are deleted as well.</p>
<p>And that is just a few. There are many other advantages. For example, security is greatly enhanced. Just because one project has access to an API, does not mean all your projects need access. The same is true for users. Not every user account needs the same level of permissions to every project. If you are going to be building anything substantial, you really need to get comfortable with creating and organizing Google Cloud Projects.</p>
<p>So now that you understand the importance of projects, let me demonstrate how to work with them in the GCP console. It’s actually pretty simple. If you want to try to follow along, you will need admin access to a GCP account. Remember, you can always sign up for a free trial at cloud.google.com.</p>
<p>Once you first log in, your screen should look similar to this. If you just created your account, then a default project has already been set up for you. It’s called “My First Project”. You can use this project, but eventually, you will want more. So let’s go through the process of creating a new project.</p>
<p>The console usually has multiple ways of accomplishing the same goal. For example, here you could click on the project selector drop-down menu at the top of the screen. And then you can click on the “New Project” button here. Or you can also go to the Navigation menu, click “IAM &amp; Admin”, and then on “Manage Resources”. From here you can see all of your projects. You might see more or less here, depending on if this is a new account or if not. I just created this account and have not defined any organizations, so it’s mostly empty except for the one default project. </p>
<p>The obvious next step is to click the “Create Project” button. Now I need to pick a project name. This can be whatever you want. Usually, I try to pick a name that describes what I am planning to build. For this example, let’s go with “Photo Blog”.</p>
<p>When you create a new project, a Project ID is automatically generated for you based upon the Project Name. Usually, it will contain the name of the project and have a random number appended to the end. The Project Name is purely for your benefit. It can be whatever you want. You can change it at any time. And it does not need to be unique. </p>
<p>The Project ID is for uniquely identifying your project. This allows GCP to distinguish your project from all others. That also means your Project ID needs to be globally unique. The ID cannot be the same as any other projects in any other account. You can see that it is possible to try to pick your own ID, but generally, I would recommend against it. It’s going to be hard to pick something clever that has not already been used by someone else. Instead, pick a good name and let Google generate the ID for you.</p>
<p>You are also asked to pick a location. If you have a more complicated setup with folders or multiple organizations, you will need to pick the correct one. But since this is a new, personal account I don’t have any of that. I will just leave it set to the default.</p>
<p>Once I click “Create”, the project will be created.</p>
<p>After creating a project, you can view the details on the Project info card on the Dashboard. You also can switch between projects by clicking on the project selector drop-down at the top of the page. Now that I have switched to the “Photo blog” project, anything I build will be assigned to that project.</p>
<p>When you no longer have use for a project, you can delete it. A project is marked for deletion for 30 days before it is actually deleted. This gives you some time to recover a project if you accidentally deleted it, or if you change your mind later. While the project is marked for deletion, it is unusable; however, its resources still count against your project quota until it is deleted. If a billing account is assigned to the project, the project may not be deleted until the current billing cycle ends.</p>
<p>To shut down a project, open the Nav menu, click on “IAM and Admin”, then click “Manage Resources”. Then simply select the Project and click the “Delete” button at the top of the page. Then you will get a confirmation warning about deleting a project. To confirm deleting, enter the Project ID. And finally, click the “Shut down” button. Be aware that deleting a project will not allow you to reuse the same Project ID. Once you use a project ID, that ID can never be used again by anyone.</p>
<p>A deleted project can be restored, as long as you do it before the end of the 30-day shutdown period. To restore a project, simply click on the “Resources Pending Deletion” button. Find the deleted project or projects that you want to restore, and select them. Then click the “Restore” link at the top of the page. And finally, confirm that you wish to restore the project by clicking the “Restore” button. So if we go back, we can confirm that the project is no longer marked for deletion.</p>
<p>So now you know how to create, delete and restore cloud projects. If you have access to a GCP account, you may want to try creating and deleting a few projects yourself to get familiar with the process.</p>
<h1 id="Adding-Users"><a href="#Adding-Users" class="headerlink" title="Adding Users"></a>Adding Users</h1><p>Typically, companies will have many different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">projects</a> with many different users working on them. And those users will often have different needs. For example, some users might need access to every project, while others might only need to access one or two. Some users will just need the ability to just look at things, while others might also need to make changes. That is why every project in your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a> account has its own set of users. And each user account can have its own unique set of permissions.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating new user accounts, you have a couple of options. First, you can manually create them yourself. This works fine if you have a small number of users. However, for large companies with hundreds or thousands of users, you may want to consider automating the process.  If you already have something like Active Directory or LDAP, you can use Google Cloud Directory Sync to automatically replicate them to Google Cloud Identity. Cloud Identity allows you to manage and authorize your user accounts across multiple applications and projects. It also supports SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), as well as two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose, you have full control over which permissions are granted to your users. This is accomplished by assigning roles. Roles are groups of permissions. You could try to directly assign individual permissions to users, but this would take a lot of time. Users typically need many, many different types of permissions to do their jobs. So to save time, you instead assign permissions to roles. And then you assign roles to users. </p>
<p>Now there are three main types of roles: basic, predefined, and custom. Basic and predefined roles are already created for you by Google. Custom roles are roles that you can create yourself.</p>
<p>Basic roles (formerly called primitive roles) represent a very simple and broad set of permissions. The Browser role allows a user to view what resources already exist, but not get any detailed information. The Viewer role allows a user to get more detailed information about resources, but not modify them. The Editor role allows a user to modify resources, but not other user accounts. And the Owner role gives a user full control. Owners can modify any resource or user account, and can also do things like set up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">billing</a>. It is generally recommended that you avoid using basic roles, especially in production <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">environments</a>. Basic roles typically either grant too many or not enough permissions.</p>
<p>Predefined roles provide smaller sets of permissions for specific resources. And because of this, there are many, many more predefined roles than basic ones. For example, if a user needed to be able to inventory all the compute engine resources, you could grant them the “Compute Viewer” predefined role. This would only allow them to view the current Compute Resources. If a user needed to modify firewall rules, you could grant them the “Compute Security Admin” predefined role. And if a user needed full control over all Compute Engine resources including VMs, security, and storage, you could grant them the “Compute Admin” predefined role.</p>
<p>The third type of role is the custom role. Custom roles are groups of permissions that can be as wide or as restricted as you wish. Predefined roles cover many typical scenarios, but can still end up granting unnecessary permissions. By defining your own Custom roles, you can assign exactly the permissions each user needs and no more.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough talk. Time to demonstrate how to create user accounts and assign roles. First, go to the Navigation menu and select “IAM &amp; Admin” and then “IAM”. Right now I just have a single user account for myself. This is the account I am using right now. Let’s add a few more.</p>
<p>Before creating a new user, always double-check that you have the right project selected. You don’t want to accidentally add a user to the wrong project. </p>
<p>Next, click the “Add” button at the top of the page. First, you will need to enter the user’s email address. So let me do that. Second, you need to pick at least one role to assign. There are the three main types of roles I talked about before. You can find Basic roles here. For this first user I will pick “Browser”. And once you click on “Save” the user will be created. So now the person with the email address of newuser1@gmail can log in and browse the resources inside of my “Photo blog” project.</p>
<p>Next, let’s add another user with some predefined roles. I will enter another email address. You can find the predefined roles down here under “All roles”. You can see that there are a lot more predefined roles than basic. There are so many, that it is often helpful to use the filter to search for the roles you are interested in. I can search for “App Engine” and get a list of App Engine related roles. So let me assign the App Engine Viewer role. You can also add more roles. You aren’t just limited to one. So let me add another predefined role. I’ll pick “BigQuery Data Viewer”. And then click “Save”.</p>
<p>So I have assigned basic and predefined roles. Let’s create a third user and assign custom roles. I have already created a few custom roles before I started filming so you could see how this work. If you want to create a new role, you can click on the “Manage Roles” link below. I’m going to assign Custom Role 1.  And also Custom Role 2. So now you know how to add new user accounts to your project. </p>
<p>Really quickly, I want to also show you how to create your own custom roles. If you select “Roles” from the side menu, you will see a list of the predefined and custom roles that exist. From here you just need to click on “Create Role” at the top of the page and you can pick a title (which is the name) and then add permissions. There are a lot of permissions to choose from, so you can also search and filter by name. I am just going to pick a few permissions at random.</p>
<p>So this new custom role is called “Custom Role 3”. It is going to have 4 assigned permissions. And once I click “Create” it will be available to use.</p>
<p>There are going to be times when you want to delete a user.  Luckily, deleting is pretty simple. Let’s go back to the IAM page. You just select the users, and then click the “Remove” button at the top of the page. Confirm that, yes, you wish to remove the users from the project. And that is all there is to it. The user accounts have been deleted.</p>
<p>As you can see, creating users and assigning them roles is fairly straightforward. The real trick is understanding what permissions your users will need. It depends on what you are building and what your requirements are. Remember, you can always change permissions later. So it is recommended to start out assigning the minimum amount of permissions at first. Then you can add more later as required. It is safer to give out too few, than too many.</p>
<p>And that wraps up the lesson on users and roles. If you can, I recommend creating a few users with different levels of permissions. Then try to log in as each and take note of the limitations on what you can see and do. </p>
<h1 id="Enabling-APIs"><a href="#Enabling-APIs" class="headerlink" title="Enabling APIs"></a>Enabling APIs</h1><p>In order to access certain Google Cloud resources, you may need to enable the corresponding API. Google Cloud APIs are application programming interfaces that give you access to certain Google Cloud services. APIs for common tasks are enabled by default. But many APIs are disabled and need to be explicitly enabled for your project before you can start using them.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing an application that interacts with a user’s Google Calendar. In order to add or modify events, you would need to enable the Google Calendar API. You can find a complete list of all APIs at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/apis">https://cloud.google.com/apis</a>. When you enable an API, the corresponding monitoring pages and billing properties are also added to your project.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate how to enable an API for a project. First, verify that you have the correct project selected in the drop down. Then go to the navigation menu and select “APIs &amp; Services” and “Dashboard”. This will show you all your currently enabled APIs. If you want to add a new one, click the “Enable APIs and Services” button at the top of the page. You can browse the list or search for the name. I’ll just pick the “Google Calendar API”. And then click the enable button. </p>
<p>Now some APIs require more than just enabling them. You might need to do some extra steps. For example, some will ask you to accept their terms of service. Others may require additional signup. Like here, I need to create some credentials to get it fully working. But we can verify that the API was enabled by going back to the Dashboard. And here we can see that the Google Calendar API has been enabled. </p>
<p>When you no longer have use for an API, you can disable it as well. To disable an API for your project, select the API. Then click the “Disable API” link at the top of the page. We can confirm it was disabled by double checking the dashboard. And there you go. The Google Calendar API is no longer listed.</p>
<p>Remember that you only want to enable the APIs you actually need in the projects that will use them. When an API is disabled, you can’t accidentally use it and avoid wasting money.</p>
<h1 id="Manage-Billing"><a href="#Manage-Billing" class="headerlink" title="Manage Billing"></a>Manage Billing</h1><p>Using Google Cloud Platform costs money. At the time of this recording, signing up for a free trial gets you $300 worth of credit for up to 90 days. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google</a> also has a free tier which gives you limited access to some GCP services as well. This free trial and free tier should provide enough to experiment with and learn, but eventually, you will need to start paying. This becomes especially true once you begin building and deploying production-ready workloads.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is important to understand how to set up billing, monitor your spending, and get detailed information on any charges. I will cover all of that in this lesson.</p>
<p>First, let me demonstrate how to add a new billing account to a project. Now if you signed up for an account, you already set up a billing by providing a credit card. But sometimes you will want to have your projects use different billing accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s start by clicking on “Billing” in the Nav menu. Then open the drop down and click on ”Manage billing accounts”. You can see my current billing account. I want to create a new one, so I will click on “Create Account”. You need to assign a name. Then select a country. This determines the currency you will be charged in. Now review the information in payments profile. It suggests using the credit card I previously entered. But I want to enter a different one, It already has my name and billing address, so I don’t need to add those. Finally, click “Submit and Enable Billing”.  And you can see that I now have two billing accounts, instead of just one.</p>
<p>Next, I want to link my new billing account to one of my projects. Click on “Account Management” to view the projects that are currently linked to your billing account. Since this is the new account, no projects are listed. I need to select the old account, to see my current projects. Now I can modify my “Photo blog” project to use the new billing account. Let me jump back to the new billing account. And we confirm that “Photo blog” is linked to it.</p>
<p>You can also disable billing. To disable billing for a project, click the Actions button to the right of the project you want to change. Then select “Disable billing”. And confirm by clicking the “Disable Billing” button. When you disable billing it simply stops automatic payments. You are still responsible for all outstanding charges for the project. So if you want to make sure you do not receive any more charges, you should also delete the project.</p>
<p>So now that you understand how to manage billing accounts, let’s cover setting a budget. Setting a budget does not create a hard cap on spending. You can still spend more than what the budget allows. Think about it. You would NOT want a production system to suddenly shut down because it exceeded it’s budget. Budgets are used for generating alerts when costs begin to rise. If you want to actually stop spending, you will need to delete the project.</p>
<p>To create a budget for a project, from the Billing page, click on “Budgets and alerts”. Then click on “Create Budget”. You will need to give your new budget a name. Then select the scope for your budget to cover. In this case, I will leave it set to “All services”. You can also tell it to filter out any discounts or promotions if you wish.</p>
<p>Next, you specify the amount of your budget. For this example, I will pick $100 because it is a nice round number.</p>
<p>Under actions, you define how and when you will be notified. By default, administrators and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a> with billing account roles will receive email alerts when the amount spent exceeds 50%, 90%, and 100% of the budget. You can change or add more thresholds if you wish. Let me add a new notification at 25%. Remember, the budget won’t actually cap your spending. Once you receive a notification, it is up to you to decide what to do.</p>
<p>You also can choose how you want to be notified. You can send emails or you can publish a message to a Pub&#x2F;Sub topic.</p>
<p>Click the Finish button and your budget will be set. Now I will get my first notification email when my spend exceeds $25. If you are using a free trial, you may want to create an alert so you do not end up getting an unexpected bill at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll show you how to generate a billing export for a project. Billing exports are detailed copies of your charges that live inside a BigQuery database. Once you have your charges in a database, you can easily filter and sort the details. You can also use DataStudio to create charts and graphs to generate reports.</p>
<p>To create a billing export, select “Billing export” from the Billing page. From here you can choose between the different types. I can pick either to export all my costs, or I can export any price changes. For this example, I want a full list of all my costs, so I’ll pick the first option.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll confirm the project I want to perform the export on. And then I have to pick a BigQuery table to export to. I do not have any BigQuery tables set up, so I will choose “Create New Dataset”. Now I have to pick a name for the new table. This must only include letters, numbers and underscores. Then I can pick where the data will reside. If you want, you can set an expiration date for the table. And finally, you can pick an encryption method. I do not want anything fancy, so I am going to stick with the defaults. Click the “Create Dataset” to confirm.</p>
<p>I can confirm that the new table has been created by clicking on the Dataset name. Now if I want, I can use BigQuery to view my bill details. I’m not going to actually demonstrate that, since using BigQuery is out of scope. If you understand how to write SQL queries, you shouldn’t have too much trouble accessing this information yourself.</p>
<p>So that’s it. You know the basics for managing billing on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">how to set up a Google Cloud Platform environment</a>. Let’s do a quick review. </p>
<p>First, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">create and delete projects</a>. You will use projects to manage and organize your GCP account.</p>
<p>Second, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">create user accounts</a> and to assign them permissions via roles. You should try to remember the three types of roles: Basic, Predefined, and Custom. Basic roles include the Browser, Viewer, Editor, and Owner roles. Basic roles are simple to use and understand, but not very secure to use in any sort of real environment. Predefined roles are more granular and are broken up into smaller groups of permissions. If a predefined role matches your need, use that. Otherwise, you can create your own custom roles for when you need something special. It is highly recommended that you avoid using basic roles, and choose predefined or custom roles instead.</p>
<p>Third, we covered enabling APIs to give you access to different Google services. These services include all kinds of things, including compute, storage, networking, and many more. You can control which resources a project has access to by enabling or disabling the associated API.</p>
<p>Fourth, I showed you how to add a billing account. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">Billing accounts</a> allow you to specify how you will pay for the services consumed in each project. Projects can share the same billing account, or can have different accounts, depending upon your needs. You can set up spending alerts for a project by setting a budget. And you analyze your spending habits by performing a billing export.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the GCP Resource Manager documentation and trying out some of the “How-to guides” at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager">https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager</a>.</p>

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Overview of Google Cloud Platform”. My name’s Guy Hummel, and I’m a Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a message, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to Google Cloud Platform, also known as GCP. It’ll give you a broad overview of the types of services available in GCP without going too deeply into any of them.</p>
<p>This course is intended for anyone who’d like to learn more about GCP, so previous experience with it isn’t necessary. It’d be helpful to have some general technical knowledge, though, because I don’t explain basic terms like file server or operating system.</p>
<p>The best way to learn is by doing, so I recommend that you try performing these tasks yourself on your own GCP account. If you don’t already have one, then you can create a free trial account.</p>
<p>To save you the trouble of typing in the URLs and commands shown in this course, I’ve put them in a readme file in a GitHub repository. You can find a link to the repository at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to describe some of the GCP services available in various categories, use the Google Cloud Console, and use the gcloud command-line interface.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re ready to learn about what you can do with Google Cloud Platform, then let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="GCP-Overview"><a href="#GCP-Overview" class="headerlink" title="GCP Overview"></a>GCP Overview</h1><p>So what is Google Cloud Platform? It’s a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications. The best part is that GCP runs in Google’s data centers, so you can take advantage of Google’s global network and vast experience with serving applications to billions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Not only does this approach save you the trouble of having to build and maintain your own on-premises IT infrastructure, but it can also save you money because you only have to pay for what you use, and you can scale your GCP resources up and down as needed.</p>
<p>For most applications, you need three core elements: compute, storage, and networking. Let’s start with compute. One of the most common ways to run applications on GCP is to use virtual machines, or VMs for short. These are machines that run either Linux or Windows. Google’s service for running VMs is called Compute Engine. If you currently have an application running on a Windows or Linux server, then the most straightforward way to migrate it to GCP is to do what’s called a “lift and shift” migration. That is, you simply lift the application from your on-premises server and shift it to a virtual server in the cloud. Compute Engine is known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service because it runs traditional IT infrastructure components that are offered as a service.</p>
<p>Google also has what’s known as a Platform-as-a-Service offering called App Engine. This platform lets you host web and mobile applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. After creating an App Engine app, you can just upload your code to it and let GCP take care of the details. It even scales the underlying resources up and down automatically. For example, if your app isn’t getting any traffic, App Engine will scale the number of underlying VMs down to zero, and you won’t get charged until your app starts getting traffic again.</p>
<p>In most cases, using App Engine is a better solution than using virtual machines, but there are times when it makes more sense to use VMs. For example, if you have an application that’s not a web or mobile app, then you can’t use App Engine, so you’ll have to use a VM.</p>
<p>These days, the hottest compute technology is containers. These are self-contained software environments. For example, a container might include a complete application plus all of the third-party packages it needs. Containers are somewhat like virtual machines except they don’t include the operating system. This makes it easy to deploy them because they’re very lightweight compared to virtual machines. In fact, containers run on virtual machines.</p>
<p>Google provides a variety of ways to run containers. The simplest way is to use Cloud Run. This service lets you run a container using a single command. If you have a more complex application that involves multiple containers, then you’ll probably want to use Google Kubernetes Engine (or GKE for short), which is a container orchestrator. It makes it easy to deploy and manage multi-container applications.</p>
<p>Another hot area is known as “serverless”. The term “serverless” is a bit misleading because it still involves servers. It just means that you don’t have to know anything about the underlying servers that run your code. That sounds like App Engine, doesn’t it? Yes, App Engine can be considered serverless. The same goes for Cloud Run. But the GCP service that’s most associated with the term “serverless” is Cloud Functions. </p>
<p>While App Engine and Cloud Run are typically used to deploy applications, Cloud Functions is used to deploy individual functions. Cloud Functions is event-driven, which means the function gets executed when a particular event occurs. For example, you could configure a function to be triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to a particular storage location.</p>
<p>Speaking of storage, let’s move on to GCP’s storage options. The simplest one is called Cloud Storage. It’s referred to as object storage, but really it’s just a collection of files. It’s not like a normal filesystem, though, because it doesn’t have a hierarchical folder structure. It has a flat structure. It’s typically used for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and log files.</p>
<p>One of the great things about it is that it has multiple storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive. Standard is for frequently accessed files. Nearline is for files you expect to access only about once a month or less. The advantage is that it costs less than Standard as long as you don’t access it frequently. Coldline is for files you expect to access at most once every three months. Archive is for files you expect to access less than once a year. It has the lowest cost.</p>
<p>All four storage classes give you immediate access to your files. This is different from some other cloud providers where the lowest cost storage can take hours to access.</p>
<p>If you need a more traditional file storage option with a hierarchical structure, you can use Filestore. It lets you create NFS-compatible file shares that can be mounted on your virtual machines or containers.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at databases. If you’re currently using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, then Cloud SQL is your best bet. It’s a fully-managed service for each of those three database systems. These are all relational databases that are suitable for online transaction processing.</p>
<p>The problem with relational databases is that it’s very difficult to scale them to handle high-volume, high-speed data. In contrast, NoSQL databases can easily scale to handle massive amounts of data. The downside is that most NoSQL databases are designed for much simpler use cases than relational databases, such as storing key&#x2F;value pairs.</p>
<p>Google offers many NoSQL databases, including Bigtable, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, and Memorystore. Bigtable is best for running large analytical workloads. Firestore is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications. Firebase Realtime Database is best for syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps. Memorystore is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.</p>
<p>Cloud Spanner is a unique database because it seems to combine the best of both worlds. It’s a relational database that’s massively scalable. So why wouldn’t you use it for all of your database needs? Well, mostly because it’s more expensive than the other options. Also, if your application is written specifically for a particular database, such as SQL Server, then Cloud SQL would be a better choice, unless you can rewrite it to work with Cloud Spanner.</p>
<p>If you need a data warehouse, then BigQuery is the right solution. It’s something you use after data is collected, rather than being a transactional system. It’s best suited to aggregating data from many sources and letting you search it using SQL queries. In other words, it’s good for OLAP (that is, Online Analytical Processing) and business intelligence reporting.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of storage and database options. Now let’s move on to networking. When you create a virtual machine on GCP, you have to put it in a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC. A VPC is very similar to an on-premises network. Each virtual machine in a VPC gets an IP address, and it can communicate with other VMs in the same VPC. You can also divide a VPC into subnets and define routes to specify how traffic should flow between them.</p>
<p>By default, all outbound traffic from a VM to the Internet is allowed. If you also want to allow inbound traffic, then you need to assign an external IP address to the VM.</p>
<p>If you want VMs in one VPC to be able to communicate with VMs in another VPC, then you can connect the VPCs together using VPC Network Peering.</p>
<p>If you want to create a secure connection between a VPC and an on-premises network, then you can use Cloud VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network, Cloud Interconnect, or Peering. A VPN sends encrypted traffic over the public Internet, whereas Cloud Interconnect and Peering communicate over a private, dedicated connection between your site and Google’s network. Cloud Interconnect is much more expensive than a VPN, but it provides higher speed and reliability since it’s a dedicated connection. Peering is free, but it’s not well-integrated with GCP, so you should usually use Cloud Interconnect instead.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other network services available as well, but the ones I’ve covered are enough to give you a good high-level understanding of GCP networking.</p>
<p>Google also provides a wide variety of other services outside of the core compute, storage, and networking categories, such as in hot areas like artificial intelligence and DevOps. I’ll go over some of those later.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand how GCP works is to actually use it, so in the next lesson, we’ll create a virtual machine. If you’re ready, then go to the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-Google-Cloud-Console"><a href="#Using-the-Google-Cloud-Console" class="headerlink" title="Using the Google Cloud Console"></a>Using the Google Cloud Console</h1><p>Now we’re going to dive into using GCP. Suppose you have a server application that you want to migrate to the cloud. As I mentioned earlier, the most straightforward way to do this is to move the application to a virtual machine on GCP.</p>
<p>There are many ways to interact with GCP. The Google Cloud Console runs in a browser, so you don’t need to install anything to use it. Alternatively, you can install the SDK, which stands for Software Development Kit. The SDK includes two types of tools. The first is what you’d expect in an SDK: a collection of client libraries that your applications can use to interact with GCP services.</p>
<p>The second is a set of command-line tools, including gcloud, gsutil, bq, and kubectl. The one you’ll use the most is gcloud, which is for managing all services other than Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>It’s actually possible to use the command-line tools from inside the browser, too, without having to install anything on your desktop. I’ll show you how to do that in the next lesson.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started, though, is to use the console, so if you’re following along on your own account, go to console.cloud.google.com. To get to the place where you can create a VM, go into the menu on the left and select “Compute Engine”. Then click “Create”.</p>
<p>First, you need to give the VM a name. Google generally refers to VMs as instances, so the default name is “instance-1”. For the purposes of this demo, we can leave it at that, but note that you can’t change the name later, so if you were creating a production instance, you’d probably want to name it something else.</p>
<p>Next, you need to set the region and the zone. Google has an extensive network of data centers around the world, and it’s adding more all the time. Each of the circles on this map represents a region, which is basically a data center. Each region contains at least three zones. A zone is essentially an independent part of a data center and has its own power, cooling, network, and security infrastructure. Google divides its data centers into at least three independent zones so that if one of them goes down, it won’t affect the other zones. So, if you distribute your resources across the zones, your applications will keep running even if one of the zones fails.</p>
<p>When you create a virtual machine, you need to say which region and zone to put it in. You can’t change this later, so make sure to choose the right location. Generally, you want to choose a location that’s closest to the people who will be using the VM. I’m going to leave it with the default of us-central1, which is in Iowa. You’ll notice that this region has more than three zones. If you’re only creating a single VM, then it doesn’t really matter which zone you pick, so I’ll just leave it with the default, which is us-central1-a.</p>
<p>Now we need to select the type of machine to create. You can choose from general-purpose, memory-optimized, and compute-optimized. For example, if you choose memory-optimized, then the VM will have way more memory per processor core than it normally would. We’ll leave it as a general-purpose machine, so it’ll have a balanced amount of compute power and memory.</p>
<p>Next, we select the processor series. If it matters to you whether your VM runs an Intel or an AMD CPU, then you can select the one you want here. Otherwise, you can just leave it as E2, which means it will pick whichever type of CPU is available.</p>
<p>Now we finally get to choose the size of the VM. Each option has a certain number of virtual CPUs and a certain amount of memory, although you can create a custom mix of CPUs and memory if you want. The options are divided into sections. If you choose a shared core option, then your VM will be sharing its compute resources with other GCP customers, which is why this is the cheapest option. The other sections are Standard, High memory, and High CPU.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why there are high memory and high CPU options considering that we chose the general-purpose family. You can choose these options if you want a moderately higher amount of memory or CPU in your VM. If you want an extremely high amount of memory or CPU, then you’ll need to choose one of the other machine families first.</p>
<p>The estimated cost per month is shown up here based on which option you choose. Right now, it says $24.86 per month, which is how much it costs for e2-medium. I’m going to set it to e2-micro, which is the smallest option. It only costs $6.52 per month.</p>
<p>Next, we need to configure the boot disk. For the operating systems, we can choose from a variety of Linux distributions or Windows Server. I’ll leave it as Debian. Then we can set the size. I’ll leave it at 10 gig.</p>
<p>If we wanted to run a web server on this instance, then we could select these checkboxes here to open the HTTP and HTTPS ports in the firewall.</p>
<p>There are lots of other options for management, security, disks, networking, etc. We can leave those with the defaults, but there’s one interesting option I want to show you. It’s called “Preemptibility”. If you make this VM a preemptible instance, then it will only run for 24 hours, and there’s even a chance that it could be removed at any time without warning. So why on earth would you want to use a preemptible instance? Well, because it would cost you about 70% less than a normal instance. For example, if you were creating a cluster of VMs to run a batch job, then it might make sense to make them preemptible instances and save a lot of money.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can click Create. One of the great things about GCP is how quickly it spins up new instances. On other platforms, I would fast-forward the video at this point, but it’s so quick on GCP that I don’t need to do that. Another thing I love about GCP is how easy it is to connect to VMs. All you have to do is click on this SSH button here. And we’re in. That’s way easier than on other platforms.</p>
<p>If you check the box beside the VM’s name on this page, you can do a few things, like stop or delete the VM, but if you want to do more, then click on the VM’s name. You can make certain changes to the VM, such as adding new disks. If you stop the VM, you can even move it to a bigger size with more memory and CPUs. If you go to the Monitoring tab, you can see lots of graphs showing things like CPU usage.</p>
<p>That’s it for this demo. If you’re following along on your own GCP account, you might want to look around and see what you can do with your new VM instance. Just remember to delete it when you’re done, so you don’t incur any ongoing charges.</p>
<p>Now if you’re ready to see how to work with GCP using the command-line interface, then please go to the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-CLI"><a href="#Using-the-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Using the CLI"></a>Using the CLI</h1><p>As you saw in the last demo, it’s pretty easy to use the portal to create GCP resources. But if you know how to use the command-line interface, you can usually create resources more quickly, often with a single command. For example, to create a virtual machine called instance-1 in the us-central1-a zone, all you need to do is type, “<code>gcloud compute instances create instance-1 --zone=us-central1-a</code>”. This will create the instance using defaults for everything. To specify particular options, you can just add them to the command.</p>
<p>But to give you some variety, in this demo, I’m going to show you how to create a website on App Engine using the command line. And we’re going to do it without installing the Google Cloud SDK on your desktop.</p>
<p>If you click on this icon, it’ll start the Cloud Shell, which is a very small virtual machine that you can use to run commands. It already has the Cloud SDK installed on it, so we don’t need to. To make it bigger, click here. This brings it up in its own browser tab.</p>
<p>For our website, we’re going to use a very simple example Google has created called the Hello World app. First, we need to download it. The command to do that is in the readme file in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/cloudacademy/gcp-overview">GitHub repository</a> for this course. The link to the repository is at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>Here’s the command. Copy it and paste it at the Cloud Shell prompt.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s done downloading, so now we need to go into the directory that has the Hello World app in it. Let’s see what’s in this directory. This is a Python app, so the main file here is called main.py. The rest of the files are basically just supporting files.</p>
<p>Now we can deploy this web application to App Engine using a single command. First, we type “<code>gcloud</code>”, which is the command-line tool used for most of GCP’s services. Then we type “<code>app</code>”, which means that we’re going to do something with App Engine. Then we type “<code>deploy</code>”, which means to deploy the files in the current directory to App Engine.</p>
<p>Now we have to authorize Cloud Shell to make a GCP API call. Just click the Authorize button. Since this is the first time deploying to App Engine in this project, it needs to create an application. We have to choose a region where the application will be deployed. We won’t be able to change it to another region later, so we have to be sure to pick the right one. I’m going to choose “us-central” again.</p>
<p>It gives the details of what it’s going to create, and it asks for confirmation. You can just hit Enter because the default choice is ‘Y’. You can tell it’s the default because it’s capitalized. This’ll take a while, so I’ll fast-forward.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s done. Now to see if it worked, copy this URL, and paste it into a browser tab. It worked. It says, “Hello World!”, which is all it’s supposed to do. That was pretty easy, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>If you’re following along on your own account, you may want to delete your App Engine instance to avoid incurring additional charges. However, because we went with the default Standard environment, App Engine will not run any VMs to serve this website unless it receives more requests. So, you shouldn’t incur any charges unless someone accesses your app’s URL for some reason.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you may want to disable it, just in case. Surprisingly, there’s currently no way to do this from the command line. The only way to do it is to go to App Engine in the console. Looks like I need to refresh this. And I need to go through a few getting started things here.</p>
<p>Okay. Now select Settings, and click the “Disable application” button. </p>
<p>And that’s it for this quick introduction to the command-line interface.</p>
<h1 id="More-Services"><a href="#More-Services" class="headerlink" title="More Services"></a>More Services</h1><p>So far, I’ve only talked about compute, storage, and networking services, but Google offers services in many other categories as well. I won’t talk about all of the GCP services available, but I’ll go over some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Most organizations that start using GCP already have on-premises systems, and they typically want to move some of the applications running on these systems to the cloud. Google provides a number of services to help with this.</p>
<p>The most popular on-premises virtualization platform is, of course, VMware, so I’ll start with how to migrate virtual machines running on VMware. The easiest way is to run them in Google Cloud VMware Engine, which is a complete VMware environment that runs on GCP.</p>
<p>If you’d rather run on Google’s standard compute services instead, then there are a couple of great options. First, Migrate for Compute Engine offers a very sophisticated way to migrate your local virtual machines from VMware to GCP. This service runs an instance on GCP while using the data attached to your local VM. It transfers the data it needs to GCP as it goes. Running the application on GCP before all of the data has been transferred makes the migration process much faster than other methods. Once the data transfer is finished, the instance reboots, and the migration is complete. In addition to VMware, Migrate for Compute Engine also supports physical machines and even VMs running on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>If you want to move from virtual machines to containers, then you can use Migrate for Anthos. It will actually convert a VM into a container that’s managed by Google Kubernetes Engine. It currently supports Linux VMs running on VMware, AWS, or Azure. It also supports migrating both Linux and Windows VMs from Google Compute Engine. So, if you want to migrate from Windows or from physical servers, then you can use Migrate for Compute Engine to move them to GCP instances, and then you can use Migrate for Anthos to move them to containers.</p>
<p>One common issue is how to move a large amount of data to GCP. Trying to transfer hundreds of terabytes of data over the internet or even Direct Interconnect would be slow and expensive. Google’s solution is called a Transfer Appliance. It’s a physical storage server that Google ships to your data center. Then you transfer your data to the appliance and ship it back to Google where it gets transferred to Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations when you’re moving to GCP is how to ensure that access to your resources is only given to the people who should have it. The most commonly used on-premises identity solution is Microsoft’s Active Directory, so as you would expect, Google has provided a way to integrate with it. Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory lets you connect your on-premises Active Directory to one that’s hosted on GCP. This allows you to authenticate your users with your existing directory.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using Active Directory, then you can use Cloud Identity instead. As you can tell from the name, it’s a cloud-based identity solution offered by Google.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s move on to one of the hottest categories. Google is known for being on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, it shocked the world when its AlphaGo software defeated one of the best human players at the Go board game.</p>
<p>If you don’t have experience with machine learning, don’t worry. Google offers lots of artificial intelligence services that don’t require any knowledge of machine learning. At the moment, Google divides these services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data.</p>
<p>Under Sight, they have the Vision API, which detects objects, faces, and text in images, and the Video Intelligence API, which recognizes objects, places, and actions in videos.</p>
<p>Under Language, they have the Translation API, which will be familiar to anyone who has used Google Translate to find out what something written in another language says. It supports over one hundred languages. They also have the Natural Language API, which performs tasks like sentiment analysis. For example, it can classify a message as being positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
<p>The Conversation category includes the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs, which do exactly what you would expect based on their names. It also includes a groundbreaking AI service called DialogFlow, which is so good at sounding like a real person, it’s almost scary. Using DialogFlow, you can build chatbots and voicebots to handle things like customer support requests.</p>
<p>The last category is Structured Data. These services allow you to feed in structured data and get back insights. For example, Recommendations AI can look at a customer’s previous purchases and recommend other products that the customer might be interested in buying.</p>
<p>All of these prebuilt AI services have been trained based on general sets of data, so they might not be able to handle your specific needs. For these scenarios, Google provides its AutoML suite of services. For example, you might need to identify product defects on the assembly lines in your factories. By feeding your own data into AutoML Vision, you can train a custom model without having to know machine learning.</p>
<p>If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use the AI Platform suite. It includes many services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction. The Training service lets you train custom models using popular Python-based frameworks, including TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.</p>
<p>The Prediction service will host your trained models and let you send requests for predictions. In machine learning terms, a prediction is basically the “answer” returned by the model for a given data record. For example, if you feed a new image into a trained model and ask what’s contained in the image, the answer it gives is called a prediction because it’s just making a very good guess.</p>
<p>All right, another area where Google is particularly strong is data analytics. Google offers so many services in this area that it can be hard to figure out which ones to use. I’ll divide them into Ingest, Store, Process, and Visualize.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the term “ingest”, it just means “load”. There are lots of ways to ingest data, but if you have a large amount of data streaming in, then you’ll likely need to use Pub&#x2F;Sub. It essentially acts as a buffer for services that may not be able to handle such large spikes of incoming data.</p>
<p>In the Store category, the main option is BigQuery, which I talked about earlier. BigQuery is also the main option for interactive analytics, that is, running queries on your data. If you need high-speed automated analytics, then Bigtable is usually the right choice.</p>
<p>The Process category is where Google has the most options. These services are used to clean and transform data. If you already have Hadoop or Spark-based code, then you can use Dataproc, which is a managed implementation of Hadoop and Spark. Alternatively, if you already have Apache Beam-based code, then you can use Dataflow. If you’re starting from scratch, you might want to choose Dataflow because Apache Beam has some advantages over Hadoop and Spark. If you’d like to do data processing without writing any code, you can use Dataprep, which actually uses Dataflow under the hood.</p>
<p>To visualize or present your data with graphs, charts, etc., you can use Data Studio or Looker. Data Studio was Google’s original visualization solution, but then Google acquired Looker, which is a more sophisticated business intelligence platform. One big difference is that Data Studio is free, but Looker isn’t. So, if you need to do simple reporting, then Data Studio should be fine, but if you want to do something more complex, then Looker is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you want to create a processing pipeline that runs tasks in multiple GCP services, then you can use Composer, which is a managed implementation of Apache Airflow. Not only can it run tasks in GCP services like Pub&#x2F;Sub, Dataflow, Dataproc, and BigQuery, it can even run tasks in on-premises environments. Data Fusion is similar to Composer except that it has a graphical interface and doesn’t require you to write any code.</p>
<p>One common source of big data is the Internet of Things, or IoT. This refers to devices, such as thermostats and light switches, that are connected to the internet. Google provides a service called IoT Core that lets you manage and ingest data from your IoT devices.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to DevOps tools. These services help you automate the building, testing, and releasing of application updates. The most important DevOps tool is Cloud Build. It lets you create continuous integration &#x2F; continuous deployment pipelines. The way it works is when you push new software updates to your code repository, it will build your application, run automated tests, and create a container or artifact for deployment.</p>
<p>Cloud Build integrates with third-party code repositories, such as Bitbucket and GitHub, but you may want to use Google’s Cloud Source Repositories, which are private Git repositories hosted on GCP. If you’re deploying your applications using containers, then you can configure Cloud Build to put the code into a container and push it to Artifact Registry, which is a private Docker image store hosted on GCP.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s go into some of Google’s most important global networking services. One way to make your web applications respond more quickly to your customers is to use a Content Delivery Network. Google offers Cloud CDN for this purpose. It caches your content on Google’s global network, which reduces the time it takes for your users to retrieve it, no matter where they’re located in the world. This is especially important if your content includes videos.</p>
<p>To make sure your application continues to be responsive when there’s a sudden increase in traffic, or even if one of Google’s data centers fails, you can use Cloud Load Balancing. It redirects application traffic to groups of VM instances distributed in different locations, and it can automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed. All of this complexity is hidden behind a single IP address.</p>
<p>Load Balancing works well for normal increases in network traffic, but what about when you’re hit by a Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack? You can use Cloud Armor, which integrates with Cloud Load Balancing.</p>
<p>Cloud Armor is a network security service, but there are many other layers of security in GCP. The most important is IAM, which stands for Identity and Access Management. Since identity is handled using an outside service, such as Cloud Identity or even Google accounts, IAM is really about access management. It lets you assign roles to users and applications. A role grants specific permissions, such as being able to create a VM instance.</p>
<p>Another important security area is encryption. GCP handles this very well because everything is encrypted by default. However, many organizations need to manage the encryption keys that are used to encrypt their data, especially to comply with certain security standards. Google provides Cloud Key Management to allow your organization to centrally manage your encryption keys.</p>
<p>A similar service is Secret Manager, which is a central place to store your API keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.</p>
<p>Finally, the Data Loss Prevention service helps you protect sensitive data. For example, if your user records contain credit card numbers, you could configure DLP to remove them before responding to a database query.</p>
<p>I’ve covered some of the most important GCP services, but there are many more that I didn’t cover. So if you have a need that doesn’t seem to fit with any of these services, there are plenty of other options. First, you can look through the Google Cloud Products page. Another way is to type what you’re looking for in the search bar in the GCP console. The search results will include not only standard GCP services but also third-party services in the Marketplace. </p>
<p>Okay, that’s it for this services overview.</p>
<h1 id="Designing-a-Solution"><a href="#Designing-a-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Designing a Solution"></a>Designing a Solution</h1><p>Now that you have a good idea of what services are available in GCP, let’s see how we can put them together to create a more complex solution. Google provides lots of sample architectures in this slide deck. It includes examples for solutions like a mobile game backend and an Internet of Things ingestion and processing system.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a more typical solution. One of the most common things people need to set up on GCP is a website. There are many different ways to do this. I already showed you a simple example using App Engine, although I should mention that App Engine is typically used for much more complex applications.</p>
<p>If you only need to set up a static website (that is, one that doesn’t have any server-side code), then believe it or not, you don’t even need to use any sort of compute service. You can just upload your website to Cloud Storage and point the DNS record for your website to it. You don’t even need to use Google’s Cloud DNS service to make this work. If your website domain is already registered with another domain registrar, then you can just update your website’s DNS record there.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you know a couple of really simple ways to create a website on GCP, but what if you need to do something more complicated? This article on Google’s site has a more complex example that uses Compute Engine. There are a lot of services in this diagram, so let’s start from scratch and work our way up to the full architecture.</p>
<p>At the heart of the solution is Compute Engine. Why would you choose this instead of App Engine considering that it takes more work to set up and maintain it? Well, the main reason is that Compute Engine gives you complete flexibility, whereas App Engine has more constraints. For example, suppose you have a web application that runs on Windows. You couldn’t host your application on App Engine because it only supports Linux. That’s not the only reason for choosing Compute Engine. There are many custom Linux configurations that won’t work on App Engine either.</p>
<p>To make sure your app stays up even if one of the zones fails, you’ll want to distribute your instances across multiple zones. If you’re expecting a lot of traffic on your website, then you’ll also want to set up autoscaling so it will add more instances as traffic increases. The way to handle both of these requirements is to put a Global Load Balancer in front of your instances.</p>
<p>Another aspect of making sure your app stays up is to make sure it can deal with Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Fortunately, you can just add Cloud Armor to mitigate DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>Next, you need to put the website’s static files somewhere. This includes things like HTML pages and images. All of the Compute Engine instances should get these static files from the same place, and the logical place to put them is Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>To speed up response time when serving static files, you can cache them in Cloud Content Delivery Network. That way, when a user requests a static file that has been requested by another user recently, they’ll retrieve it from the cache instead of waiting for a Compute Engine instance to retrieve it from Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>That takes care of the web front-end, but now you need to set up the backend. That is, you need to set up the part of the application that handles dynamic content and stores new data. Although you could put the backend on the same instances that serve the front-end, it’s usually better to host it on separate instances, especially for high-traffic applications.</p>
<p>These backend app server instances should also be distributed across zones and configured for autoscaling. However, since these instances will be communicating with the front-end instances rather than with end-users, you need to use an Internal Load Balancer.</p>
<p>The App Server instances also need a central place for their data, but since they’ll deal with dynamic data, Cloud Storage is not the right place for it. There are a few options depending on what type of data you need to store and retrieve. The most commonly used service is probably Cloud SQL because it can handle transaction processing.</p>
<p>Although you could probably use Cloud SQL for all of your backend database needs, you might want to use a NoSQL database to handle some of the simpler types of data that need to be accessed more frequently. Firestore is a NoSQL database, so it’s faster and more scalable than Cloud SQL, but it can only work with certain types of data, such as user profiles and product catalogs.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use Google’s Cloud DNS service to help users find your website, but as I mentioned earlier, it’s not a requirement. If you’re already using a third-party DNS service, you can keep using it. </p>
<p>There are, of course, lots of other services you could add to this architecture, too. One important consideration is how to manage your application once it’s running. That’ll be the focus of the next video, so if you’re ready, then I’ll see you there.</p>
<h1 id="Management-Services"><a href="#Management-Services" class="headerlink" title="Management Services"></a>Management Services</h1><p>Once you’ve deployed applications on GCP, you’ll need to maintain them. Google provides many services to help with that.</p>
<p>One of the most important is the Cloud Operations suite, which was formerly known as Stackdriver. Cloud Monitoring gives you a great overview of what’s happening with all of your resources. By default, it provides graphs showing metrics like CPU utilization, response latency, and network traffic. You can also create your own custom graphs and dashboards. But an even more critical feature is that you can set up alerts to notify you if there are problems. For example, you can set up an uptime check that alerts you if a virtual machine goes down. </p>
<p>Another useful service in the Cloud Operations suite is Cloud Logging. This is a central place where you can search all of the logs related to your resources, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The suite also includes Error Reporting, Cloud Trace, Cloud Debugger, and Cloud Profiler to debug live applications and track down performance problems.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring performance, you’ll also need to monitor security and compliance. Security Command Center gathers this information in one place. Its overview dashboard shows you active threats and vulnerabilities, ordered by severity. For example, if one of your applications is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, then that vulnerability will show up in the list. Security Command Center also includes a compliance dashboard that lets you know about violations of compliance standards, such as PCI-DSS, in your GCP environment.</p>
<p>So far in this course, I’ve talked about creating GCP resources manually, but once you’re happy with a particular configuration for a resource, such as a virtual machine, you’ll probably want to create nearly identical resources in a more automated way.</p>
<p>Google’s solution is Cloud Deployment Manager. To use it, you create a configuration file with all the details of the GCP resources you want to create, and then you feed it to Cloud Deployment Manager. What makes it really powerful is that you can define the configuration of multiple, interconnected resources, such as two VM instances and a Cloud SQL database. Then you can deploy all of them at once.</p>
<p>Google has many other management tools as well, but these are the ones you’ll probably use the most often.</p>
<p>And that’s it for management services.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about GCP. Let’s do a quick review of what you learned.</p>
<p>Google Cloud Platform is a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications, and it runs in Google’s data centers around the world.</p>
<p>GCP’s primary compute offerings are Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Run, Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>Compute Engine runs virtual machines, which Google calls instances. A preemptible instance is a VM that will only run for 24 hours, and Google can remove it at any time without warning. Preemptible instances cost about 70% less than normal instances.</p>
<p>App Engine runs web and mobile applications. Cloud Run and Kubernetes Engine run containers. Cloud Functions runs individual functions. App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions are referred to as serverless.</p>
<p>In the raw storage area, Google provides Cloud Storage for unstructured objects and Filestore for traditional file sharing.</p>
<p>GCP’s relational database offerings are Cloud SQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, and Cloud Spanner, which is a massively scalable database that can run globally.</p>
<p>Google’s NoSQL offerings include Bigtable, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, and Memorystore. Bigtable is best for running large analytical workloads. Firestore is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications. Firebase Realtime Database is best for syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps. Memorystore is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.</p>
<p>Google’s data warehouse service is BigQuery.</p>
<p>GCP’s equivalent of an on-premises network is a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC. You can connect VPCs together using VPC Network Peering. To create a secure connection between a VPC and an on-premises network, you can use Cloud VPN, which runs over the internet, or you can create a dedicated, private connection using either Cloud Interconnect or Peering.</p>
<p>Google offers lots of options for migrating your on-premises applications. VMware Engine is a complete VMware environment that runs on GCP. Migrate for Compute Engine helps you migrate your local virtual machines from VMware to GCP. Migrate for Anthos will convert a VM into a container that’s managed by Google Kubernetes Engine. The Transfer Appliance is a physical storage server that you can use to ship large amounts of data to Google.</p>
<p>For authentication, Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory lets you connect your on-premises Active Directory to one that’s hosted on GCP. If you aren’t using Active Directory, then you can use Cloud Identity instead.</p>
<p>Google offers lots of artificial intelligence services that don’t require any knowledge of machine learning. At the moment, Google divides these services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data. Some of the key APIs are Vision, Video Intelligence, Translation, Natural Language, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, DialogFlow, and Recommendations.</p>
<p>If you need to train models using custom data, but you still don’t want to write any machine learning code, you may be able to use Google’s AutoML suite of services to do it. If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use the AI Platform suite. It includes many services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction.</p>
<p>Google is particularly strong in the data analytics area. Pub&#x2F;Sub acts as a buffer for services that may not be able to handle huge spikes of incoming data. BigQuery is the main option for storage and interactive analytics.</p>
<p>Dataproc is a managed implementation of Hadoop and Spark. Dataflow is a managed implementation of Apache Beam. Dataprep lets you do data processing without writing any code, and it uses Dataflow under the hood. To visualize or present your data with graphs, charts, etc., you can use Data Studio or Looker. Data Studio is free, but Looker is a more sophisticated business intelligence platform.</p>
<p>If you want to create a processing pipeline that runs tasks in multiple GCP services, then you can use Composer, which is a managed implementation of Apache Airflow. Data Fusion is similar to Composer except that it has a graphical interface and doesn’t require you to write any code.</p>
<p>To manage and ingest data from Internet of Things devices, Google offers IoT Core.</p>
<p>Cloud Build lets you create continuous integration &#x2F; continuous deployment pipelines. Cloud Source Repositories are private Git repositories hosted on GCP. Artifact Registry is a private artifact store hosted on GCP.</p>
<p>Cloud CDN caches your content on Google’s global network, which reduces the time it takes for your users to retrieve it. Cloud Load Balancing redirects application traffic to groups of VM instances distributed in different locations, and it can automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed. You can use Cloud Armor to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks. </p>
<p>Identity and Access Management, or IAM, lets you assign roles to users and applications. Everything in GCP is encrypted by default. Cloud Key Management allows organizations to manage their encryption keys. Secret Manager is a place to store your API keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. The Data Loss Prevention service helps you protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers.</p>
<p>The Cloud Operations suite includes Monitoring, Logging, Error Reporting, Trace, Debugger, and Profiler. The Security Command Center shows you active security threats and vulnerabilities as well as compliance violations. Cloud Deployment Manager lets you automate the creation of GCP resources.</p>
<p>A region is basically a data center. Each region contains at least three zones. A zone is essentially an independent part of a data center and has its own power, cooling, network, and security infrastructure. Google divides its data centers into at least three independent zones so that if one of them goes down, it won’t affect the other zones.</p>
<p>You can interact with GCP using the web console, command-line tools, including gcloud, gsutil, bq, and kubectl, or by calling the Cloud SDK client libraries from your applications.</p>
<p>To learn more about GCP, please look through our Google Cloud Platform Library. We have courses, labs, and practice exams on nearly every GCP topic, and we have more content coming out all the time.</p>
<p>Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks and have fun with Google Cloud Platform!</p>

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Google Associate Cloud Engineer Exam Preparation. The focus of this learning path is to prepare you for Google’s Associate Cloud Engineer Exam. However, if you’re not planning on sitting for the exam, this learning path will help you get started on your way to becoming a Google Associate Cloud Engineer! My name’s Thomas Mitchell and I’m a GCP Course Author at Cloud Academy. The Associate Cloud Engineer Exam will test your knowledge in several key subject areas. You’ll be expected to understand how to set up a cloud solution environment using Google Cloud Platform services and solutions. You’ll also need to know how to plan, configure, deploy, and implement cloud solutions using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">GCP platform</a>. Lastly, you’ll need to be able to maintain successful operation of cloud solutions deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>This learning path has been designed to align closely with the published learning objectives covered by the Google Associate Cloud Engineer Exam. That being the case, we’ll cover the setup of cloud projects and accounts along with billing configuration management on the platform. We’ll also tackle the installation and configuration of the command-line interface. Next, we’ll dive into the pricing calculator and how to plan and estimate GCP product pricing. After covering the calculator, we’ll get into planning and configuring GCP compute resources, data storage options, and network resources. As you progress through this learning path, you’ll learn how to deploy and implement Computer Engine resources, Google Kubernetes Engine resources, App Engine, Cloud Run and Cloud Functions resources. You’ll also learn how to deploy and implement data solutions as well as network resources. After you’ve learned all that, you’ll learn how to deploy solutions using Cloud Marketplace and how to deploy application infrastructure using Cloud Deployment Manager. Later in this learning path, you’ll learn how to manage the resources that you deployed, you’ll also learn how to manage your storage solutions, database solutions, and networking resources. Rounding out this learning path, we’ll cover identity and access management, service account management, and auditing for project and managed services. We certainly have lots of ground to cover, so let’s get started!</p>
