<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Overview of Google Cloud Platform”. My name’s Guy Hummel, and I’m a Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a message, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to Google Cloud Platform, also known as GCP. It’ll give you a broad overview of the types of services available in GCP without going too deeply into any of them.</p>
<p>This course is intended for anyone who’d like to learn more about GCP, so previous experience with it isn’t necessary. It’d be helpful to have some general technical knowledge, though, because I don’t explain basic terms like file server or operating system.</p>
<p>The best way to learn is by doing, so I recommend that you try performing these tasks yourself on your own GCP account. If you don’t already have one, then you can create a free trial account.</p>
<p>To save you the trouble of typing in the URLs and commands shown in this course, I’ve put them in a readme file in a GitHub repository. You can find a link to the repository at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to describe some of the GCP services available in various categories, use the Google Cloud Console, and use the gcloud command-line interface.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re ready to learn about what you can do with Google Cloud Platform, then let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="GCP-Overview"><a href="#GCP-Overview" class="headerlink" title="GCP Overview"></a>GCP Overview</h1><p>So what is Google Cloud Platform? It’s a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications. The best part is that GCP runs in Google’s data centers, so you can take advantage of Google’s global network and vast experience with serving applications to billions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Not only does this approach save you the trouble of having to build and maintain your own on-premises IT infrastructure, but it can also save you money because you only have to pay for what you use, and you can scale your GCP resources up and down as needed.</p>
<p>For most applications, you need three core elements: compute, storage, and networking. Let’s start with compute. One of the most common ways to run applications on GCP is to use virtual machines, or VMs for short. These are machines that run either Linux or Windows. Google’s service for running VMs is called Compute Engine. If you currently have an application running on a Windows or Linux server, then the most straightforward way to migrate it to GCP is to do what’s called a “lift and shift” migration. That is, you simply lift the application from your on-premises server and shift it to a virtual server in the cloud. Compute Engine is known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service because it runs traditional IT infrastructure components that are offered as a service.</p>
<p>Google also has what’s known as a Platform-as-a-Service offering called App Engine. This platform lets you host web and mobile applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. After creating an App Engine app, you can just upload your code to it and let GCP take care of the details. It even scales the underlying resources up and down automatically. For example, if your app isn’t getting any traffic, App Engine will scale the number of underlying VMs down to zero, and you won’t get charged until your app starts getting traffic again.</p>
<p>In most cases, using App Engine is a better solution than using virtual machines, but there are times when it makes more sense to use VMs. For example, if you have an application that’s not a web or mobile app, then you can’t use App Engine, so you’ll have to use a VM.</p>
<p>These days, the hottest compute technology is containers. These are self-contained software environments. For example, a container might include a complete application plus all of the third-party packages it needs. Containers are somewhat like virtual machines except they don’t include the operating system. This makes it easy to deploy them because they’re very lightweight compared to virtual machines. In fact, containers run on virtual machines.</p>
<p>Google provides a variety of ways to run containers. The simplest way is to use Cloud Run. This service lets you run a container using a single command. If you have a more complex application that involves multiple containers, then you’ll probably want to use Google Kubernetes Engine (or GKE for short), which is a container orchestrator. It makes it easy to deploy and manage multi-container applications.</p>
<p>Another hot area is known as “serverless”. The term “serverless” is a bit misleading because it still involves servers. It just means that you don’t have to know anything about the underlying servers that run your code. That sounds like App Engine, doesn’t it? Yes, App Engine can be considered serverless. The same goes for Cloud Run. But the GCP service that’s most associated with the term “serverless” is Cloud Functions. </p>
<p>While App Engine and Cloud Run are typically used to deploy applications, Cloud Functions is used to deploy individual functions. Cloud Functions is event-driven, which means the function gets executed when a particular event occurs. For example, you could configure a function to be triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to a particular storage location.</p>
<p>Speaking of storage, let’s move on to GCP’s storage options. The simplest one is called Cloud Storage. It’s referred to as object storage, but really it’s just a collection of files. It’s not like a normal filesystem, though, because it doesn’t have a hierarchical folder structure. It has a flat structure. It’s typically used for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and log files.</p>
<p>One of the great things about it is that it has multiple storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive. Standard is for frequently accessed files. Nearline is for files you expect to access only about once a month or less. The advantage is that it costs less than Standard as long as you don’t access it frequently. Coldline is for files you expect to access at most once every three months. Archive is for files you expect to access less than once a year. It has the lowest cost.</p>
<p>All four storage classes give you immediate access to your files. This is different from some other cloud providers where the lowest cost storage can take hours to access.</p>
<p>If you need a more traditional file storage option with a hierarchical structure, you can use Filestore. It lets you create NFS-compatible file shares that can be mounted on your virtual machines or containers.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at databases. If you’re currently using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, then Cloud SQL is your best bet. It’s a fully-managed service for each of those three database systems. These are all relational databases that are suitable for online transaction processing.</p>
<p>The problem with relational databases is that it’s very difficult to scale them to handle high-volume, high-speed data. In contrast, NoSQL databases can easily scale to handle massive amounts of data. The downside is that most NoSQL databases are designed for much simpler use cases than relational databases, such as storing key&#x2F;value pairs.</p>
<p>Google offers many NoSQL databases, including Bigtable, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, and Memorystore. Bigtable is best for running large analytical workloads. Firestore is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications. Firebase Realtime Database is best for syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps. Memorystore is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.</p>
<p>Cloud Spanner is a unique database because it seems to combine the best of both worlds. It’s a relational database that’s massively scalable. So why wouldn’t you use it for all of your database needs? Well, mostly because it’s more expensive than the other options. Also, if your application is written specifically for a particular database, such as SQL Server, then Cloud SQL would be a better choice, unless you can rewrite it to work with Cloud Spanner.</p>
<p>If you need a data warehouse, then BigQuery is the right solution. It’s something you use after data is collected, rather than being a transactional system. It’s best suited to aggregating data from many sources and letting you search it using SQL queries. In other words, it’s good for OLAP (that is, Online Analytical Processing) and business intelligence reporting.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of storage and database options. Now let’s move on to networking. When you create a virtual machine on GCP, you have to put it in a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC. A VPC is very similar to an on-premises network. Each virtual machine in a VPC gets an IP address, and it can communicate with other VMs in the same VPC. You can also divide a VPC into subnets and define routes to specify how traffic should flow between them.</p>
<p>By default, all outbound traffic from a VM to the Internet is allowed. If you also want to allow inbound traffic, then you need to assign an external IP address to the VM.</p>
<p>If you want VMs in one VPC to be able to communicate with VMs in another VPC, then you can connect the VPCs together using VPC Network Peering.</p>
<p>If you want to create a secure connection between a VPC and an on-premises network, then you can use Cloud VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network, Cloud Interconnect, or Peering. A VPN sends encrypted traffic over the public Internet, whereas Cloud Interconnect and Peering communicate over a private, dedicated connection between your site and Google’s network. Cloud Interconnect is much more expensive than a VPN, but it provides higher speed and reliability since it’s a dedicated connection. Peering is free, but it’s not well-integrated with GCP, so you should usually use Cloud Interconnect instead.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other network services available as well, but the ones I’ve covered are enough to give you a good high-level understanding of GCP networking.</p>
<p>Google also provides a wide variety of other services outside of the core compute, storage, and networking categories, such as in hot areas like artificial intelligence and DevOps. I’ll go over some of those later.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand how GCP works is to actually use it, so in the next lesson, we’ll create a virtual machine. If you’re ready, then go to the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-Google-Cloud-Console"><a href="#Using-the-Google-Cloud-Console" class="headerlink" title="Using the Google Cloud Console"></a>Using the Google Cloud Console</h1><p>Now we’re going to dive into using GCP. Suppose you have a server application that you want to migrate to the cloud. As I mentioned earlier, the most straightforward way to do this is to move the application to a virtual machine on GCP.</p>
<p>There are many ways to interact with GCP. The Google Cloud Console runs in a browser, so you don’t need to install anything to use it. Alternatively, you can install the SDK, which stands for Software Development Kit. The SDK includes two types of tools. The first is what you’d expect in an SDK: a collection of client libraries that your applications can use to interact with GCP services.</p>
<p>The second is a set of command-line tools, including gcloud, gsutil, bq, and kubectl. The one you’ll use the most is gcloud, which is for managing all services other than Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>It’s actually possible to use the command-line tools from inside the browser, too, without having to install anything on your desktop. I’ll show you how to do that in the next lesson.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started, though, is to use the console, so if you’re following along on your own account, go to console.cloud.google.com. To get to the place where you can create a VM, go into the menu on the left and select “Compute Engine”. Then click “Create”.</p>
<p>First, you need to give the VM a name. Google generally refers to VMs as instances, so the default name is “instance-1”. For the purposes of this demo, we can leave it at that, but note that you can’t change the name later, so if you were creating a production instance, you’d probably want to name it something else.</p>
<p>Next, you need to set the region and the zone. Google has an extensive network of data centers around the world, and it’s adding more all the time. Each of the circles on this map represents a region, which is basically a data center. Each region contains at least three zones. A zone is essentially an independent part of a data center and has its own power, cooling, network, and security infrastructure. Google divides its data centers into at least three independent zones so that if one of them goes down, it won’t affect the other zones. So, if you distribute your resources across the zones, your applications will keep running even if one of the zones fails.</p>
<p>When you create a virtual machine, you need to say which region and zone to put it in. You can’t change this later, so make sure to choose the right location. Generally, you want to choose a location that’s closest to the people who will be using the VM. I’m going to leave it with the default of us-central1, which is in Iowa. You’ll notice that this region has more than three zones. If you’re only creating a single VM, then it doesn’t really matter which zone you pick, so I’ll just leave it with the default, which is us-central1-a.</p>
<p>Now we need to select the type of machine to create. You can choose from general-purpose, memory-optimized, and compute-optimized. For example, if you choose memory-optimized, then the VM will have way more memory per processor core than it normally would. We’ll leave it as a general-purpose machine, so it’ll have a balanced amount of compute power and memory.</p>
<p>Next, we select the processor series. If it matters to you whether your VM runs an Intel or an AMD CPU, then you can select the one you want here. Otherwise, you can just leave it as E2, which means it will pick whichever type of CPU is available.</p>
<p>Now we finally get to choose the size of the VM. Each option has a certain number of virtual CPUs and a certain amount of memory, although you can create a custom mix of CPUs and memory if you want. The options are divided into sections. If you choose a shared core option, then your VM will be sharing its compute resources with other GCP customers, which is why this is the cheapest option. The other sections are Standard, High memory, and High CPU.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why there are high memory and high CPU options considering that we chose the general-purpose family. You can choose these options if you want a moderately higher amount of memory or CPU in your VM. If you want an extremely high amount of memory or CPU, then you’ll need to choose one of the other machine families first.</p>
<p>The estimated cost per month is shown up here based on which option you choose. Right now, it says $24.86 per month, which is how much it costs for e2-medium. I’m going to set it to e2-micro, which is the smallest option. It only costs $6.52 per month.</p>
<p>Next, we need to configure the boot disk. For the operating systems, we can choose from a variety of Linux distributions or Windows Server. I’ll leave it as Debian. Then we can set the size. I’ll leave it at 10 gig.</p>
<p>If we wanted to run a web server on this instance, then we could select these checkboxes here to open the HTTP and HTTPS ports in the firewall.</p>
<p>There are lots of other options for management, security, disks, networking, etc. We can leave those with the defaults, but there’s one interesting option I want to show you. It’s called “Preemptibility”. If you make this VM a preemptible instance, then it will only run for 24 hours, and there’s even a chance that it could be removed at any time without warning. So why on earth would you want to use a preemptible instance? Well, because it would cost you about 70% less than a normal instance. For example, if you were creating a cluster of VMs to run a batch job, then it might make sense to make them preemptible instances and save a lot of money.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can click Create. One of the great things about GCP is how quickly it spins up new instances. On other platforms, I would fast-forward the video at this point, but it’s so quick on GCP that I don’t need to do that. Another thing I love about GCP is how easy it is to connect to VMs. All you have to do is click on this SSH button here. And we’re in. That’s way easier than on other platforms.</p>
<p>If you check the box beside the VM’s name on this page, you can do a few things, like stop or delete the VM, but if you want to do more, then click on the VM’s name. You can make certain changes to the VM, such as adding new disks. If you stop the VM, you can even move it to a bigger size with more memory and CPUs. If you go to the Monitoring tab, you can see lots of graphs showing things like CPU usage.</p>
<p>That’s it for this demo. If you’re following along on your own GCP account, you might want to look around and see what you can do with your new VM instance. Just remember to delete it when you’re done, so you don’t incur any ongoing charges.</p>
<p>Now if you’re ready to see how to work with GCP using the command-line interface, then please go to the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-CLI"><a href="#Using-the-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Using the CLI"></a>Using the CLI</h1><p>As you saw in the last demo, it’s pretty easy to use the portal to create GCP resources. But if you know how to use the command-line interface, you can usually create resources more quickly, often with a single command. For example, to create a virtual machine called instance-1 in the us-central1-a zone, all you need to do is type, “<code>gcloud compute instances create instance-1 --zone=us-central1-a</code>”. This will create the instance using defaults for everything. To specify particular options, you can just add them to the command.</p>
<p>But to give you some variety, in this demo, I’m going to show you how to create a website on App Engine using the command line. And we’re going to do it without installing the Google Cloud SDK on your desktop.</p>
<p>If you click on this icon, it’ll start the Cloud Shell, which is a very small virtual machine that you can use to run commands. It already has the Cloud SDK installed on it, so we don’t need to. To make it bigger, click here. This brings it up in its own browser tab.</p>
<p>For our website, we’re going to use a very simple example Google has created called the Hello World app. First, we need to download it. The command to do that is in the readme file in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/cloudacademy/gcp-overview">GitHub repository</a> for this course. The link to the repository is at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>Here’s the command. Copy it and paste it at the Cloud Shell prompt.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s done downloading, so now we need to go into the directory that has the Hello World app in it. Let’s see what’s in this directory. This is a Python app, so the main file here is called main.py. The rest of the files are basically just supporting files.</p>
<p>Now we can deploy this web application to App Engine using a single command. First, we type “<code>gcloud</code>”, which is the command-line tool used for most of GCP’s services. Then we type “<code>app</code>”, which means that we’re going to do something with App Engine. Then we type “<code>deploy</code>”, which means to deploy the files in the current directory to App Engine.</p>
<p>Now we have to authorize Cloud Shell to make a GCP API call. Just click the Authorize button. Since this is the first time deploying to App Engine in this project, it needs to create an application. We have to choose a region where the application will be deployed. We won’t be able to change it to another region later, so we have to be sure to pick the right one. I’m going to choose “us-central” again.</p>
<p>It gives the details of what it’s going to create, and it asks for confirmation. You can just hit Enter because the default choice is ‘Y’. You can tell it’s the default because it’s capitalized. This’ll take a while, so I’ll fast-forward.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s done. Now to see if it worked, copy this URL, and paste it into a browser tab. It worked. It says, “Hello World!”, which is all it’s supposed to do. That was pretty easy, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>If you’re following along on your own account, you may want to delete your App Engine instance to avoid incurring additional charges. However, because we went with the default Standard environment, App Engine will not run any VMs to serve this website unless it receives more requests. So, you shouldn’t incur any charges unless someone accesses your app’s URL for some reason.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you may want to disable it, just in case. Surprisingly, there’s currently no way to do this from the command line. The only way to do it is to go to App Engine in the console. Looks like I need to refresh this. And I need to go through a few getting started things here.</p>
<p>Okay. Now select Settings, and click the “Disable application” button. </p>
<p>And that’s it for this quick introduction to the command-line interface.</p>
<h1 id="More-Services"><a href="#More-Services" class="headerlink" title="More Services"></a>More Services</h1><p>So far, I’ve only talked about compute, storage, and networking services, but Google offers services in many other categories as well. I won’t talk about all of the GCP services available, but I’ll go over some of the highlights.</p>
<p>Most organizations that start using GCP already have on-premises systems, and they typically want to move some of the applications running on these systems to the cloud. Google provides a number of services to help with this.</p>
<p>The most popular on-premises virtualization platform is, of course, VMware, so I’ll start with how to migrate virtual machines running on VMware. The easiest way is to run them in Google Cloud VMware Engine, which is a complete VMware environment that runs on GCP.</p>
<p>If you’d rather run on Google’s standard compute services instead, then there are a couple of great options. First, Migrate for Compute Engine offers a very sophisticated way to migrate your local virtual machines from VMware to GCP. This service runs an instance on GCP while using the data attached to your local VM. It transfers the data it needs to GCP as it goes. Running the application on GCP before all of the data has been transferred makes the migration process much faster than other methods. Once the data transfer is finished, the instance reboots, and the migration is complete. In addition to VMware, Migrate for Compute Engine also supports physical machines and even VMs running on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>If you want to move from virtual machines to containers, then you can use Migrate for Anthos. It will actually convert a VM into a container that’s managed by Google Kubernetes Engine. It currently supports Linux VMs running on VMware, AWS, or Azure. It also supports migrating both Linux and Windows VMs from Google Compute Engine. So, if you want to migrate from Windows or from physical servers, then you can use Migrate for Compute Engine to move them to GCP instances, and then you can use Migrate for Anthos to move them to containers.</p>
<p>One common issue is how to move a large amount of data to GCP. Trying to transfer hundreds of terabytes of data over the internet or even Direct Interconnect would be slow and expensive. Google’s solution is called a Transfer Appliance. It’s a physical storage server that Google ships to your data center. Then you transfer your data to the appliance and ship it back to Google where it gets transferred to Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>One of the most important considerations when you’re moving to GCP is how to ensure that access to your resources is only given to the people who should have it. The most commonly used on-premises identity solution is Microsoft’s Active Directory, so as you would expect, Google has provided a way to integrate with it. Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory lets you connect your on-premises Active Directory to one that’s hosted on GCP. This allows you to authenticate your users with your existing directory.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using Active Directory, then you can use Cloud Identity instead. As you can tell from the name, it’s a cloud-based identity solution offered by Google.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s move on to one of the hottest categories. Google is known for being on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, it shocked the world when its AlphaGo software defeated one of the best human players at the Go board game.</p>
<p>If you don’t have experience with machine learning, don’t worry. Google offers lots of artificial intelligence services that don’t require any knowledge of machine learning. At the moment, Google divides these services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data.</p>
<p>Under Sight, they have the Vision API, which detects objects, faces, and text in images, and the Video Intelligence API, which recognizes objects, places, and actions in videos.</p>
<p>Under Language, they have the Translation API, which will be familiar to anyone who has used Google Translate to find out what something written in another language says. It supports over one hundred languages. They also have the Natural Language API, which performs tasks like sentiment analysis. For example, it can classify a message as being positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
<p>The Conversation category includes the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs, which do exactly what you would expect based on their names. It also includes a groundbreaking AI service called DialogFlow, which is so good at sounding like a real person, it’s almost scary. Using DialogFlow, you can build chatbots and voicebots to handle things like customer support requests.</p>
<p>The last category is Structured Data. These services allow you to feed in structured data and get back insights. For example, Recommendations AI can look at a customer’s previous purchases and recommend other products that the customer might be interested in buying.</p>
<p>All of these prebuilt AI services have been trained based on general sets of data, so they might not be able to handle your specific needs. For these scenarios, Google provides its AutoML suite of services. For example, you might need to identify product defects on the assembly lines in your factories. By feeding your own data into AutoML Vision, you can train a custom model without having to know machine learning.</p>
<p>If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use the AI Platform suite. It includes many services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction. The Training service lets you train custom models using popular Python-based frameworks, including TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.</p>
<p>The Prediction service will host your trained models and let you send requests for predictions. In machine learning terms, a prediction is basically the “answer” returned by the model for a given data record. For example, if you feed a new image into a trained model and ask what’s contained in the image, the answer it gives is called a prediction because it’s just making a very good guess.</p>
<p>All right, another area where Google is particularly strong is data analytics. Google offers so many services in this area that it can be hard to figure out which ones to use. I’ll divide them into Ingest, Store, Process, and Visualize.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the term “ingest”, it just means “load”. There are lots of ways to ingest data, but if you have a large amount of data streaming in, then you’ll likely need to use Pub&#x2F;Sub. It essentially acts as a buffer for services that may not be able to handle such large spikes of incoming data.</p>
<p>In the Store category, the main option is BigQuery, which I talked about earlier. BigQuery is also the main option for interactive analytics, that is, running queries on your data. If you need high-speed automated analytics, then Bigtable is usually the right choice.</p>
<p>The Process category is where Google has the most options. These services are used to clean and transform data. If you already have Hadoop or Spark-based code, then you can use Dataproc, which is a managed implementation of Hadoop and Spark. Alternatively, if you already have Apache Beam-based code, then you can use Dataflow. If you’re starting from scratch, you might want to choose Dataflow because Apache Beam has some advantages over Hadoop and Spark. If you’d like to do data processing without writing any code, you can use Dataprep, which actually uses Dataflow under the hood.</p>
<p>To visualize or present your data with graphs, charts, etc., you can use Data Studio or Looker. Data Studio was Google’s original visualization solution, but then Google acquired Looker, which is a more sophisticated business intelligence platform. One big difference is that Data Studio is free, but Looker isn’t. So, if you need to do simple reporting, then Data Studio should be fine, but if you want to do something more complex, then Looker is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you want to create a processing pipeline that runs tasks in multiple GCP services, then you can use Composer, which is a managed implementation of Apache Airflow. Not only can it run tasks in GCP services like Pub&#x2F;Sub, Dataflow, Dataproc, and BigQuery, it can even run tasks in on-premises environments. Data Fusion is similar to Composer except that it has a graphical interface and doesn’t require you to write any code.</p>
<p>One common source of big data is the Internet of Things, or IoT. This refers to devices, such as thermostats and light switches, that are connected to the internet. Google provides a service called IoT Core that lets you manage and ingest data from your IoT devices.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to DevOps tools. These services help you automate the building, testing, and releasing of application updates. The most important DevOps tool is Cloud Build. It lets you create continuous integration &#x2F; continuous deployment pipelines. The way it works is when you push new software updates to your code repository, it will build your application, run automated tests, and create a container or artifact for deployment.</p>
<p>Cloud Build integrates with third-party code repositories, such as Bitbucket and GitHub, but you may want to use Google’s Cloud Source Repositories, which are private Git repositories hosted on GCP. If you’re deploying your applications using containers, then you can configure Cloud Build to put the code into a container and push it to Artifact Registry, which is a private Docker image store hosted on GCP.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s go into some of Google’s most important global networking services. One way to make your web applications respond more quickly to your customers is to use a Content Delivery Network. Google offers Cloud CDN for this purpose. It caches your content on Google’s global network, which reduces the time it takes for your users to retrieve it, no matter where they’re located in the world. This is especially important if your content includes videos.</p>
<p>To make sure your application continues to be responsive when there’s a sudden increase in traffic, or even if one of Google’s data centers fails, you can use Cloud Load Balancing. It redirects application traffic to groups of VM instances distributed in different locations, and it can automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed. All of this complexity is hidden behind a single IP address.</p>
<p>Load Balancing works well for normal increases in network traffic, but what about when you’re hit by a Distributed Denial of Service, or DDoS, attack? You can use Cloud Armor, which integrates with Cloud Load Balancing.</p>
<p>Cloud Armor is a network security service, but there are many other layers of security in GCP. The most important is IAM, which stands for Identity and Access Management. Since identity is handled using an outside service, such as Cloud Identity or even Google accounts, IAM is really about access management. It lets you assign roles to users and applications. A role grants specific permissions, such as being able to create a VM instance.</p>
<p>Another important security area is encryption. GCP handles this very well because everything is encrypted by default. However, many organizations need to manage the encryption keys that are used to encrypt their data, especially to comply with certain security standards. Google provides Cloud Key Management to allow your organization to centrally manage your encryption keys.</p>
<p>A similar service is Secret Manager, which is a central place to store your API keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.</p>
<p>Finally, the Data Loss Prevention service helps you protect sensitive data. For example, if your user records contain credit card numbers, you could configure DLP to remove them before responding to a database query.</p>
<p>I’ve covered some of the most important GCP services, but there are many more that I didn’t cover. So if you have a need that doesn’t seem to fit with any of these services, there are plenty of other options. First, you can look through the Google Cloud Products page. Another way is to type what you’re looking for in the search bar in the GCP console. The search results will include not only standard GCP services but also third-party services in the Marketplace. </p>
<p>Okay, that’s it for this services overview.</p>
<h1 id="Designing-a-Solution"><a href="#Designing-a-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Designing a Solution"></a>Designing a Solution</h1><p>Now that you have a good idea of what services are available in GCP, let’s see how we can put them together to create a more complex solution. Google provides lots of sample architectures in this slide deck. It includes examples for solutions like a mobile game backend and an Internet of Things ingestion and processing system.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a more typical solution. One of the most common things people need to set up on GCP is a website. There are many different ways to do this. I already showed you a simple example using App Engine, although I should mention that App Engine is typically used for much more complex applications.</p>
<p>If you only need to set up a static website (that is, one that doesn’t have any server-side code), then believe it or not, you don’t even need to use any sort of compute service. You can just upload your website to Cloud Storage and point the DNS record for your website to it. You don’t even need to use Google’s Cloud DNS service to make this work. If your website domain is already registered with another domain registrar, then you can just update your website’s DNS record there.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you know a couple of really simple ways to create a website on GCP, but what if you need to do something more complicated? This article on Google’s site has a more complex example that uses Compute Engine. There are a lot of services in this diagram, so let’s start from scratch and work our way up to the full architecture.</p>
<p>At the heart of the solution is Compute Engine. Why would you choose this instead of App Engine considering that it takes more work to set up and maintain it? Well, the main reason is that Compute Engine gives you complete flexibility, whereas App Engine has more constraints. For example, suppose you have a web application that runs on Windows. You couldn’t host your application on App Engine because it only supports Linux. That’s not the only reason for choosing Compute Engine. There are many custom Linux configurations that won’t work on App Engine either.</p>
<p>To make sure your app stays up even if one of the zones fails, you’ll want to distribute your instances across multiple zones. If you’re expecting a lot of traffic on your website, then you’ll also want to set up autoscaling so it will add more instances as traffic increases. The way to handle both of these requirements is to put a Global Load Balancer in front of your instances.</p>
<p>Another aspect of making sure your app stays up is to make sure it can deal with Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Fortunately, you can just add Cloud Armor to mitigate DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>Next, you need to put the website’s static files somewhere. This includes things like HTML pages and images. All of the Compute Engine instances should get these static files from the same place, and the logical place to put them is Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>To speed up response time when serving static files, you can cache them in Cloud Content Delivery Network. That way, when a user requests a static file that has been requested by another user recently, they’ll retrieve it from the cache instead of waiting for a Compute Engine instance to retrieve it from Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>That takes care of the web front-end, but now you need to set up the backend. That is, you need to set up the part of the application that handles dynamic content and stores new data. Although you could put the backend on the same instances that serve the front-end, it’s usually better to host it on separate instances, especially for high-traffic applications.</p>
<p>These backend app server instances should also be distributed across zones and configured for autoscaling. However, since these instances will be communicating with the front-end instances rather than with end-users, you need to use an Internal Load Balancer.</p>
<p>The App Server instances also need a central place for their data, but since they’ll deal with dynamic data, Cloud Storage is not the right place for it. There are a few options depending on what type of data you need to store and retrieve. The most commonly used service is probably Cloud SQL because it can handle transaction processing.</p>
<p>Although you could probably use Cloud SQL for all of your backend database needs, you might want to use a NoSQL database to handle some of the simpler types of data that need to be accessed more frequently. Firestore is a NoSQL database, so it’s faster and more scalable than Cloud SQL, but it can only work with certain types of data, such as user profiles and product catalogs.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use Google’s Cloud DNS service to help users find your website, but as I mentioned earlier, it’s not a requirement. If you’re already using a third-party DNS service, you can keep using it. </p>
<p>There are, of course, lots of other services you could add to this architecture, too. One important consideration is how to manage your application once it’s running. That’ll be the focus of the next video, so if you’re ready, then I’ll see you there.</p>
<h1 id="Management-Services"><a href="#Management-Services" class="headerlink" title="Management Services"></a>Management Services</h1><p>Once you’ve deployed applications on GCP, you’ll need to maintain them. Google provides many services to help with that.</p>
<p>One of the most important is the Cloud Operations suite, which was formerly known as Stackdriver. Cloud Monitoring gives you a great overview of what’s happening with all of your resources. By default, it provides graphs showing metrics like CPU utilization, response latency, and network traffic. You can also create your own custom graphs and dashboards. But an even more critical feature is that you can set up alerts to notify you if there are problems. For example, you can set up an uptime check that alerts you if a virtual machine goes down. </p>
<p>Another useful service in the Cloud Operations suite is Cloud Logging. This is a central place where you can search all of the logs related to your resources, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The suite also includes Error Reporting, Cloud Trace, Cloud Debugger, and Cloud Profiler to debug live applications and track down performance problems.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring performance, you’ll also need to monitor security and compliance. Security Command Center gathers this information in one place. Its overview dashboard shows you active threats and vulnerabilities, ordered by severity. For example, if one of your applications is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, then that vulnerability will show up in the list. Security Command Center also includes a compliance dashboard that lets you know about violations of compliance standards, such as PCI-DSS, in your GCP environment.</p>
<p>So far in this course, I’ve talked about creating GCP resources manually, but once you’re happy with a particular configuration for a resource, such as a virtual machine, you’ll probably want to create nearly identical resources in a more automated way.</p>
<p>Google’s solution is Cloud Deployment Manager. To use it, you create a configuration file with all the details of the GCP resources you want to create, and then you feed it to Cloud Deployment Manager. What makes it really powerful is that you can define the configuration of multiple, interconnected resources, such as two VM instances and a Cloud SQL database. Then you can deploy all of them at once.</p>
<p>Google has many other management tools as well, but these are the ones you’ll probably use the most often.</p>
<p>And that’s it for management services.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about GCP. Let’s do a quick review of what you learned.</p>
<p>Google Cloud Platform is a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications, and it runs in Google’s data centers around the world.</p>
<p>GCP’s primary compute offerings are Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Run, Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>Compute Engine runs virtual machines, which Google calls instances. A preemptible instance is a VM that will only run for 24 hours, and Google can remove it at any time without warning. Preemptible instances cost about 70% less than normal instances.</p>
<p>App Engine runs web and mobile applications. Cloud Run and Kubernetes Engine run containers. Cloud Functions runs individual functions. App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions are referred to as serverless.</p>
<p>In the raw storage area, Google provides Cloud Storage for unstructured objects and Filestore for traditional file sharing.</p>
<p>GCP’s relational database offerings are Cloud SQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server, and Cloud Spanner, which is a massively scalable database that can run globally.</p>
<p>Google’s NoSQL offerings include Bigtable, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, and Memorystore. Bigtable is best for running large analytical workloads. Firestore is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications. Firebase Realtime Database is best for syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps. Memorystore is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.</p>
<p>Google’s data warehouse service is BigQuery.</p>
<p>GCP’s equivalent of an on-premises network is a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC. You can connect VPCs together using VPC Network Peering. To create a secure connection between a VPC and an on-premises network, you can use Cloud VPN, which runs over the internet, or you can create a dedicated, private connection using either Cloud Interconnect or Peering.</p>
<p>Google offers lots of options for migrating your on-premises applications. VMware Engine is a complete VMware environment that runs on GCP. Migrate for Compute Engine helps you migrate your local virtual machines from VMware to GCP. Migrate for Anthos will convert a VM into a container that’s managed by Google Kubernetes Engine. The Transfer Appliance is a physical storage server that you can use to ship large amounts of data to Google.</p>
<p>For authentication, Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory lets you connect your on-premises Active Directory to one that’s hosted on GCP. If you aren’t using Active Directory, then you can use Cloud Identity instead.</p>
<p>Google offers lots of artificial intelligence services that don’t require any knowledge of machine learning. At the moment, Google divides these services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data. Some of the key APIs are Vision, Video Intelligence, Translation, Natural Language, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, DialogFlow, and Recommendations.</p>
<p>If you need to train models using custom data, but you still don’t want to write any machine learning code, you may be able to use Google’s AutoML suite of services to do it. If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use the AI Platform suite. It includes many services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction.</p>
<p>Google is particularly strong in the data analytics area. Pub&#x2F;Sub acts as a buffer for services that may not be able to handle huge spikes of incoming data. BigQuery is the main option for storage and interactive analytics.</p>
<p>Dataproc is a managed implementation of Hadoop and Spark. Dataflow is a managed implementation of Apache Beam. Dataprep lets you do data processing without writing any code, and it uses Dataflow under the hood. To visualize or present your data with graphs, charts, etc., you can use Data Studio or Looker. Data Studio is free, but Looker is a more sophisticated business intelligence platform.</p>
<p>If you want to create a processing pipeline that runs tasks in multiple GCP services, then you can use Composer, which is a managed implementation of Apache Airflow. Data Fusion is similar to Composer except that it has a graphical interface and doesn’t require you to write any code.</p>
<p>To manage and ingest data from Internet of Things devices, Google offers IoT Core.</p>
<p>Cloud Build lets you create continuous integration &#x2F; continuous deployment pipelines. Cloud Source Repositories are private Git repositories hosted on GCP. Artifact Registry is a private artifact store hosted on GCP.</p>
<p>Cloud CDN caches your content on Google’s global network, which reduces the time it takes for your users to retrieve it. Cloud Load Balancing redirects application traffic to groups of VM instances distributed in different locations, and it can automatically scale the number of instances up or down as needed. You can use Cloud Armor to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks. </p>
<p>Identity and Access Management, or IAM, lets you assign roles to users and applications. Everything in GCP is encrypted by default. Cloud Key Management allows organizations to manage their encryption keys. Secret Manager is a place to store your API keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets. The Data Loss Prevention service helps you protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers.</p>
<p>The Cloud Operations suite includes Monitoring, Logging, Error Reporting, Trace, Debugger, and Profiler. The Security Command Center shows you active security threats and vulnerabilities as well as compliance violations. Cloud Deployment Manager lets you automate the creation of GCP resources.</p>
<p>A region is basically a data center. Each region contains at least three zones. A zone is essentially an independent part of a data center and has its own power, cooling, network, and security infrastructure. Google divides its data centers into at least three independent zones so that if one of them goes down, it won’t affect the other zones.</p>
<p>You can interact with GCP using the web console, command-line tools, including gcloud, gsutil, bq, and kubectl, or by calling the Cloud SDK client libraries from your applications.</p>
<p>To learn more about GCP, please look through our Google Cloud Platform Library. We have courses, labs, and practice exams on nearly every GCP topic, and we have more content coming out all the time.</p>
<p>Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks and have fun with Google Cloud Platform!</p>

          <h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations! You’ve made it all the way to the end of this learning path. If you’re preparing to sit the Google Associate Cloud Engineer exam, keep in mind that, although this learning path covers most of the key learning objectives for the exam, there are a few topics that weren’t covered as in depth as some others. For example, you may want to brush up on the process for converting Cloud Storage buckets between storage classes. The URL that you see on your screen can help you with this.

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to our “Introduction to Google Cloud Operations Suite”. I’m Guy Hummel, and I’ll be showing you how to monitor your GCP systems.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should know the fundamentals of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, such as how to create virtual machine instances and use App Engine. If you need a refresher, then you can take our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/google-cloud-platform-fundamentals/">Google Cloud Platform: Fundamentals</a> course.</p>
<p>You should also have experience with performing operations tasks, especially working with Linux. It would also be helpful to have some programming experience, although just knowing the basics of a typical programming language should be enough.</p>
<p>This is a hands-on course with lots of demonstrations. The best way to learn is by doing, so I recommend that you try performing these tasks yourself on your own Google Cloud account. If you don’t have one, then you can sign up for a free trial.</p>
<p>We’ll be going through the components of the Cloud Operations suite to monitor, log, report errors, debug, and trace your applications.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re ready to learn how to monitor your Google Cloud infrastructure, then let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="Lectures"><a href="#Lectures" class="headerlink" title="Lectures"></a>Lectures</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/monitoring-gcs/">Monitoring</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/logging-gcs/">Logging</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/error-reporting-and-debugging-gcs/">Error Reporting and Debugging</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/tracing-gcs/">Tracing</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/summary/">Summary</a></p>
<h1 id="Monitoring"><a href="#Monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring"></a>Monitoring</h1><p>After you’ve implemented your infrastructure in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud platform</a>, the first thing you’ll want to do is set up a monitoring system that will alert you when there are major problems. The easiest way to do this is to use Cloud Operations, Google’s powerful monitoring, logging, and debugging tool.</p>
<p>To get to it, select “Monitoring” from the console menu. The first time you bring up Monitoring in a project, it’ll take a while to set up. I’ll fast-forward.</p>
<p>Here’s where you’ll find the instructions for installing the Monitoring Agent (and the Logging Agent). You don’t need to install the agent to be able to use Monitoring, but if you do install it, you can get more information about an instance, such as about the third-party software running on it. We don’t need to install it yet, so we’ll leave that until later.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to monitor a web server and get notified if it goes down. First, you need to create an Uptime Check. </p>
<p>For the title, let’s call it “Example”. Click “Next”. Since we want to check if a web server is up, leave the Protocol as HTTP and the Resource Type as URL.</p>
<p>For the hostname, I’m going to put in the IP address of an instance I have that’s running a web server. Leave “Check Frequency” set to 1 minute. And click “Next”. We can leave the Response Validation with the defaults, so click “Next” again.</p>
<p>This is where we set up an alert for when the uptime check fails. First, we specify how long a failure has to last before it’ll trigger an alert. Let’s leave it set to 1 minute. We should also tell it how to send alert notifications. Click the dropdown menu, and then click “Manage Notification Channels”. You can be alerted by email, text message, or a variety of other options, such as Slack. We’ll get it to send an email when the web server is down. Click “Add New”, and enter your email address and your name.</p>
<p>Okay, now close this tab in your browser, and go back to the previous one. Click Refresh and select your email. Now click the “Test” button. Since the web server at that address is up, it came back right away.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to stop Apache on the instance that’s running the web server and test it again. This time, the connection failed, as expected. Click the Create button.</p>
<p>To see the results of the uptime check, go to the menu on the left and select Uptime Checks. It’ll take a while before it runs for the first time, so don’t worry if you don’t see anything in the dashboard right away. I’ll skip ahead to when the uptime check has run. OK, now you can see it’s showing that the web server’s down. After a little while, it’ll send a notification email. Here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p>Now I’ll start Apache up again and see if the alert policy sees it. I’ll just skip ahead a few minutes. Yes, it sees that the web server is up now.</p>
<p>If you want to see data graphically, then click on Dashboards. It provides default dashboards for many Google services. To create your own, click Create Dashboard. I’ll call it “Example Dashboard”.</p>
<p>Now click the “Add Chart” button. In this search field, type “URL”. There’s the resource type we need. It’s called “Uptime Check URL”. It gives us a few different metrics to choose from. The obvious one to choose is “Check passed”, but to make things more interesting, let’s choose “Request latency”. Click Save and the graph will be added to your dashboard.</p>
<p>This graph shows the network latency between each region and the web server. You can see when the web server was down, but it gives us more information than that. This network latency data from different locations around the world can be quite helpful, especially if some of your users are reporting slow performance.</p>
<p>Note that you’ll need to refresh this page to see the latest data. You can turn on auto-refresh if you want.</p>
<p>Suppose you’d like to get more information about the instance where the web server is running, such as the CPU load. Let’s create another chart.In the search field, type “cpu load”. Let’s select the 1-minute version. For the resource type, select “VM instance”. Notice that you can even monitor Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the chart is blank. That’s because we need to install the Monitoring Agent to get CPU data.</p>
<p>Go back to the Overview, and then click this link to bring up the installation instructions. The instructions are different depending on which Linux distribution you’re running on your instance. I’m running Debian, so I need to follow these instructions. I’ll fast-forward to the point after I’ve run all of the install commands.</p>
<p>While we’re here, let’s install the logging agent too. You can find a link to the documentation in the GitHub repository I created for this course. The link to the GitHub repository is at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>Installing the logging agent will prepare this instance for the next lesson when we use Cloud Logging. I’ll fast-forward again.</p>
<p>Now let’s go back and see what happened to our chart. Okay, now there’s a line showing the load average, so it worked.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along using your own account, then you should go back and delete the monitoring you set up. First, go to the Alerting page from the menu, and then delete the policy. You have to do that before it will let you delete the uptime check. Okay, now go to “Uptime Checks” and delete the one you created. Finally, go to Dashboards, click on the one you created, and delete it.</p>
<p>That’s it for this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="Lectures-1"><a href="#Lectures-1" class="headerlink" title="Lectures"></a>Lectures</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/introduction/">Introduction</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/logging-gcs/">Logging</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/error-reporting-and-debugging-gcs/">Error Reporting and Debugging</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/tracing-gcs/">Tracing</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/summary/">Summary</a></p>
<h1 id="Logging"><a href="#Logging" class="headerlink" title="Logging"></a>Logging</h1><p>Looking at real-time monitoring is great, but there will be many times when you’ll want to look at what happened in the past. In other words, you need logs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I wanted to see when a VM instance was shut down. Compute Engine, like almost every other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a> service, writes to the Cloud Audit Logs. These logs keep track of who did what, where, and when.</p>
<p>There are three types of audit logs. Admin Activity logs track any actions that modify a resource. This includes everything from shutting down VMs to modifying permissions.</p>
<p>System Event logs track Google’s actions on Compute Engine resources. Some examples are maintenance of the underlying host and reclaiming a preemptible instance.</p>
<p>Data Access logs are pretty self-explanatory. They track data requests. Note that this also includes read requests on configurations and metadata. Since these logs can grow very quickly, they’re disabled by default. One exception is BigQuery Data Access logs, which are not only enabled by default, but it’s not even possible to disable them. Fortunately, you won’t get charged for them, though.</p>
<p>In the console, select “Logging”.</p>
<p>There are lots of options for filtering what you see here. You can look at the logs for your VM instances, firewall rules, projects, and many other components. You can even send logs from other cloud platforms like AWS to here. You just need to install the logging agent on any system that you want to get logs from.</p>
<p>This is a great way to centralize all of your logs. Not only does centralizing your logs make it easier to search for issues, but it can also help with security and compliance, because the logs aren’t easy to edit from a compromised node.</p>
<p>In this case, we need to look at the VM instance logs. You can choose a specific instance or all instances. I only have one instance right now, called instance-1. Since we installed the logging agent on instance-1 in the last lesson, there are already some log entries for it. </p>
<p>Here you can choose which logs you want from the instance, such as the Apache access and error logs. I could set it to “syslog” since that’s where the shutdown message will be, but I’ll just leave it at “All logs” because sometimes you might not know which log to look in.</p>
<p>You can also filter by log level, and for example, only look at critical entries. I’ll leave it at “Any log level”.</p>
<p>Finally, you can change how far back it will look for log entries. I’ll change it to the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>OK, now I’ll search for any entries that contain the word “shutdown” so I can see if this instance was shut down in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>If you need to do really serious log analysis, then you can export the logs to BigQuery, which is Google’s data warehouse and analytics service. Before you can do that, you need to have the right permissions to export the logs. If you are the project owner then, of course, you have permission. If you’re not, then the “Create Sink” button will be greyed out, and you’ll have to ask a project owner to give you the Logs Configuration Writer role.</p>
<p>First, click the “Create Sink” button. A sink is a place where you want to send your data. Give your sink a name, such as “example-sink”. Under “Sink Service”, you have quite a few options, such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or a Custom destination. We’ll choose BigQuery. </p>
<p>Under “Sink Destination”, you have to choose a BigQuery dataset to receive the logs. If you don’t have one already, then click “Create new BigQuery dataset”. Give it a name, such as “example_dataset”. Note that I used an underscore instead of a dash because dashes are not allowed in BigQuery dataset names. Now click the “Create Sink” button.</p>
<p>It says the sink was created, so let’s jump over to BigQuery and see what’s there. Hmmm. It created our example dataset, but it doesn’t contain any tables, which means it doesn’t have any data. That’s weird, right? Well, it’s because when you set up a sink, it only starts exporting log entries that were made after the sink was created.</p>
<p>OK, then let’s generate some more log entries and see if they get exported. I’ll restart the VM, which will generate lots of log entries. Okay, I’ve restarted it. Now if we go back to the Logging page, do we see the new messages? Yes, we do.</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to BigQuery and see if the data’s there. Yes, there are two tables there now. Click on the syslog table. Now click the “Query Table” button. To do a search in BigQuery, you need to use SQL statements, so let’s write a simple one just to verify that the log entries are there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it already gave me the skeleton of a SQL statement. I just need to fill in what I’m selecting. I’ll put in an asterisk to select everything, but I’ll restrict it by using a WHERE clause with the column name “textPayload” (which is the column that contains the text in the log entry)…”LIKE ‘%shutdown%’”. The percent signs are wildcards, so this SQL statement says to find any log entries that have the word “shutdown” in them somewhere.</p>
<p>Now we click the “Run” button…and it returns the matching log entries. If we scroll to the right, then we can see the textPayload field and it does indeed contain the word “shutdown” in each of the entries.</p>
<p>Of course, we did exactly the same search on the Logging page and it was way easier, so why would we want to go through all of this hassle of exporting to BigQuery and writing SQL statements? Well, because sometimes you may need to search through a huge number of log entries and need to do complicated queries. BigQuery is lightning fast when searching through big data, and if you build a complex infrastructure in Google Cloud Platform, then the volume of log data it will generate will easily qualify as big data.</p>
<p>Since we don’t want our example sink to keep exporting logs to BigQuery and incurring storage charges, let’s delete what we’ve created. On the Logging page, click on “Logs Router” in the left-hand menu, then select the sink and delete it.</p>
<p>We should also delete the BigQuery dataset, so go back to the BigQuery page, select the dataset, and click “Delete Dataset”. It wants you to be sure that you actually want to delete the dataset, so you have to type the dataset name before it will delete it.</p>
<p>One concern that you or your company may have is how to ensure the integrity of your logs. Many hackers try to cover their tracks by modifying or deleting log entries. There are a number of steps you can take to make it more difficult to do that.</p>
<p>First, apply the principle of least privilege. That is, give users the lowest level of privilege they need to perform their tasks. In this case, only give the owner role for projects and log buckets to people who absolutely need it.</p>
<p>Second, track changes by implementing object versioning on the log buckets. The Cloud Storage service automatically encrypts all data before it is written to the log buckets, but you can increase security by forcing a new version to be saved whenever an object in a log bucket is changed. Unfortunately, this won’t prevent an owner from deleting an incriminating object, which is why you need to keep tight control on which users are given the owner role.</p>
<p>Third, you could add more protection by requiring two people to inspect the logs. You could copy the logs to another project with a different owner using either a cron job or the Cloud Storage Transfer Service. Of course, this still won’t prevent an owner in the first project from deleting the original bucket before the copy occurs or from disabling the original logging.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that a person with the owner role can get around just about anything you put in place, but you can make it nearly impossible for someone without the owner role to change the logs without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>And that’s it for this lesson.</p>

<h1 id="Error-Reporting-and-Debugging"><a href="#Error-Reporting-and-Debugging" class="headerlink" title="Error Reporting and Debugging"></a>Error Reporting and Debugging</h1><p>So far, we’ve been looking at alerts and log messages from system software. Now it’s time to look at how to get error information from your applications. That’s where the Cloud Error Reporting service comes in. To show you how this works, I’m going to install Google’s Hello World application in App Engine and then get it to generate an error.</p>
<p>Normally, you’d use your own workstation for the development environment, but to simplify this demo, I’m going to use Cloud Shell. The nice thing about Cloud Shell is that it already has all of the packages installed that you need. When you do want to write and test Java code on your own workstation, remember that you need to install the Google Cloud SDK, the Java SE 11 Development Kit, Git, and Maven 3.5 or greater on your system.</p>
<p>First, open Cloud Shell. Next, get a copy of the Hello World application with this “git clone” command. Then go into the directory where the app is.</p>
<p>Now use the local development server to make sure the app works. To see if it’s working, click the “Web Preview” icon, and select “Preview on port 8080”. You should see a “Hello world!” message. OK, it’s working, so let’s stop the development server and upload the application to App Engine. You can stop the development server with a Ctrl-C.</p>
<p>Now use the “gcloud app deploy” command to upload it to App Engine. If you’re doing this yourself, then it may look slightly different than mine because I’ve already configured App Engine. If this is your first time deploying to App Engine, then it will likely ask you to choose a region. OK, it’s done deploying.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to test it. If you’re not using Cloud Shell, then you could do a “gcloud app browse”, which is pretty handy. Since we are using Cloud Shell, we’ll have to go to this URL. There’s “Hello World!” again.</p>
<p>Now, in order to see an error on the Error Reporting page, we need to generate an error. Let’s edit the code and mess something up. I’m going to add a line that I know will cause a problem. This’ll throw an exception because you can’t divide a number by zero.</p>
<p>Now run “gcloud app deploy” again. When it’s done, bring the app up in your browser again. This time it gives you a big error message, which is actually what we want, for once.</p>
<p>Let’s see if Error Reporting picked it up. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud</a> Console shows errors on the main dashboard, so you don’t have to go to the Error Reporting page to see them. I’ll refresh the page. There it is. Click on “Go to Error Reporting” to see what it shows. If you click on the error, you’ll see more details, including the stack trace. You can even click on the line where the error occurred and it will take you into your source code in the Debugger. However, in this case, the line it’s showing at the top of the stack trace is not in our code. We can click on this line, though, which is in our code, and it should take us there.</p>
<p>The Debugger is a great tool that you can use whether an error occurred or not. Let’s put a more subtle problem in the code and see how we can use the Debugger to figure out what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to check the operating system running our app, and if it’s Ubuntu, then we’ll print “Ubuntu rocks!”</p>
<p>First, we have to fix the bug that we introduced previously, so we’ll remove that line. We have to go back to the editor to do that. Now I’ll add the new code. Even if you’re not familiar with Java, this is pretty straightforward. It gets the name of the operating system, then it checks to see whether it’s equal to Ubuntu or not, and if it is, it says, “Ubuntu rocks!”, and if it isn’t, it says, “Hello world!”.</p>
<p>Now we’ll upload it to App Engine again. OK, now we’ll refresh the webpage. And it says “Hello world!” again, not “Ubuntu rocks!” That might be because the underlying operating system isn’t Ubuntu, but let’s go back to the Debugger and see if that’s the reason.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that this is still the old version of the file. First, refresh the browser. It’s still showing the old version. To get to the new version, you have to click on this drop-down menu and select the right one. The latest version should say 100% at the end. Sometimes you have to tell it where the source code is. Find “App Engine” in the list, and click the “Select source” button.</p>
<p>Now find the file. You’ll see some text on the right-hand side that says to click a line number to take a snapshot of the variables and call stack. It also points out that taking a snapshot does not stop the running application, which is good to know.</p>
<p>Click in the left-hand gutter on the line just after the “osname” variable is set. Now that the snapshot point is set, we can refresh the webpage and trigger the snapshot. If we go back to the Debugger tab, you’ll see that it’s showing the variables and call stack on the right-hand side. There’s “osname”. It’s set to “Linux”, not anything more specific. I guess it doesn’t know the specific distribution of Linux that’s running, so let’s change our code to check for Linux instead.</p>
<p>And deploy the new version. Now refresh the webpage. It worked!</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the main Error Reporting page and I’ll show you a couple of other things. First, if you’re sitting on this page watching for errors in real-time, then you should click the “AUTO RELOAD” button, which will refresh the page every 5 seconds. If you don’t want to hang around here and just want to get an email when an error occurs, then click the “Turn on notifications” button.</p>
<p>Alright, that’s it for this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="Lectures-3"><a href="#Lectures-3" class="headerlink" title="Lectures"></a>Lectures</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/introduction/">Introduction</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/monitoring-gcs/">Monitoring</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/logging-gcs/">Logging</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/tracing-gcs/">Tracing</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-google-cloud-operations-suite/summary/">Summary</a></p>
<h1 id="Tracing"><a href="#Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Tracing"></a>Tracing</h1><p>In the last lesson, we looked at how to debug errors in your application, but what do you do if your application is working properly but performing too slowly? That’s what Cloud Profiler and Cloud Trace are used for. In this lesson, I’m only going to talk about Cloud Trace.</p>
<p>The Trace List is probably where you will spend most of your time. It shows you all of the traces over a specific period of time in this cool graph. It is set to “1 hour” right now, but we can change that to give a longer view. Each one of these dots is a trace of an individual request to the application. If you click on one of the dots, it brings up two more panes underneath. The Waterfall View shows what happened during the request. The first bar shows the total end-to-end time, which was 215 milliseconds in this case. The bars underneath show the time it took to complete calls performed when handling the request. In this case, we have one bar for an HTTP GET request.</p>
<p>Of course, this timeline would be a lot more useful if we were running a more complex application with multiple calls so you could see which ones were taking the most time. Each of those calls would have a bar on this chart. The Hello World application is about the simplest application possible, so you’ll just have to use your imagination here.</p>
<p>Analysis reports show you the latency distribution for your application and also attempt to identify performance bottlenecks, which is a great feature. You have to have at least 100 traces before you can run a report, though.</p>
<p>If you’re running your applications in App Engine, then it’ll automatically capture and submit traces, but if you want to trace code that’s running outside of App Engine, then you’ll have to either add instrumentation code to your applications using the Trace SDK or submit traces through the API.</p>
<p>Before we go, you might want to delete your application, so it doesn’t incur charges. Go to App Engine and then go to Settings. Click “Disable application”. It will ask you to type the app’s ID before you can click “DISABLE”. This doesn’t delete the application, but it does stop it from serving requests. To start the application up again, you can just click “Enable application”.</p>
<p>If you want to permanently delete the application, then you’ll have to delete the project it’s associated with, which you can do in the “IAM &amp; Admin” page. Be aware that if you delete a project, you will never be able to use that project ID again. That is, you won’t be able to create a new project with the same ID.</p>
<p>That’s it for this lesson.</p>

<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about the Cloud Operations Suite. Let’s do a quick review of what you learned.</p>
<p>You can use the Cloud Operations suite (formerly known as Stackdriver) for monitoring, logging, error reporting, debugging, profiling, and tracing your applications.</p>
<p>You don’t need to install the Monitoring Agent to be able to use Monitoring, but if you do install it, you can get more information about an instance, such as about the third-party software running on it.</p>
<p>To monitor a server, first you need to create an Uptime Check. Then you need to set up an Alert Policy. To see data graphically, create a Dashboard. </p>
<p>Cloud Audit Logs keep track of who did what, where, and when. There are three types of audit logs. Admin Activity logs track any actions that modify a resource. This includes everything from shutting down VMs to modifying permissions. System Event logs track Google’s actions on Compute Engine resources. Some examples are maintenance of the underlying host and reclaiming a preemptible instance. Data Access logs track data requests, including read requests on configurations and metadata.</p>
<p>Cloud Logging can even collect logs from other cloud platforms like AWS. You just need to install the Logging Agent on any system that you want to get logs from.</p>
<p>If you need to do serious log analysis, then you can export the logs to BigQuery. In this case, BigQuery acts as a sink for log data. To do a search in BigQuery, you need to use SQL statements.</p>
<p>The Error Reporting service alerts you to errors in your applications. You can use the Debugger to figure out what’s causing an error.</p>
<p>Cloud Profiler and Cloud Trace are used to analyze performance problems in applications. A trace is an individual request to an application. Cloud Trace shows you how much time was taken by each of the calls generated by an application request.</p>
<p>If you’re running your applications in App Engine, then it’ll automatically capture and submit traces. If you want to trace code that’s running outside of App Engine, then you’ll have to add instrumentation code to your applications. The recommended way is to use OpenTelemetry and the associated Cloud Trace client library.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Cloud Operations suite, you can read Google’s documentation.

          <h1 id="Storage-Management"><a href="#Storage-Management" class="headerlink" title="Storage Management"></a>Storage Management</h1><p>Once you’ve set up your Cloud Storage buckets and applied the right security settings to them, you’ll still need to manage them on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>One of your first tasks will likely be to get data into your Cloud Storage buckets. If you need to upload data from an on-premise location, then you have three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Cloud Storage console</li>
<li>gsutil, or</li>
<li>Offline media import &#x2F; export</li>
</ol>
<p>The easiest way is to click on a bucket in the Cloud Storage console and then click “Upload Files” or “Upload Folder”. You can even view the uploaded file from the console if it’s the type of file that a web browser knows how to display.</p>
<p>The second way is to use the “gsutil” command. For example, to upload a folder called “example-folder” from your desktop, you would use “gsutil cp -r Desktop&#x2F;example-folder” and then put “gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;” and the name of the bucket. Now, if we go back to the Cloud Storage console, we can see the uploaded folder.</p>
<p>If you have a slow or expensive Internet connection, then you may want to use the third option, which is to ship your data on offline media. One way is to send hard disks, storage arrays, tapes, or other media to a third-party provider, such as Iron Mountain, and let them upload your data. </p>
<p>Another way is to use a Transfer Appliance supplied by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google</a>. Here’s how it works. You submit a request for a Transfer Appliance, which Google then ships to you. When you receive it, you install it in your data center and transfer your data to it. Then you ship it back to Google so they can upload it for you.</p>
<p>There are still more steps to perform, though, because the data on the Transfer Appliance is encrypted. First, Google uploads your encrypted data to a staging bucket in Cloud Storage. Next, you have to launch and configure what’s called a rehydrator instance. Then you run a rehydrator job on the instance, which will decrypt the data and copy it to a Cloud Storage bucket of your choosing. Finally, you delete the instance and send Google a request to erase the data from the Transfer Appliance and the staging bucket.</p>
<p>If you need to transfer data from another cloud provider, then you can use the Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service. I’ll show you how it works.</p>
<p>Click “Transfer” in the left-hand menu. Then click the “Create transfer” button. Under “Select source”, there are three options: you can transfer from another Google Cloud Storage bucket, an Amazon S3 bucket, or from a URL. I’m going to transfer from another Cloud Storage bucket to simulate transferring from another cloud provider because it works the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Browse button and select the bucket. Then say which files to include in the transfer by specifying their prefix, such as “example”. You can also exclude files in the same way. Another option is to specify that you only want files modified recently, say in the last 24 hours. Of course, if you want to copy the entire contents of the bucket, then you don’t need to put in any filters.</p>
<p>Now choose the destination bucket. There are also some options for how it handles overwrites and deletions. By default, an object will only be overwritten when the source version is different from the destination version. Also by default, no objects will be deleted from either the source or the destination. I’ll just leave it with the default settings.</p>
<p>Then you specify when you want the transfer to happen. You can either run it now or schedule it to run at a particular time every day. I’ll just run it now. The transfer is going to take a little while, so I’ll fast forward until it’s done. It’s a bit tedious to transfer files manually like this, which is why scheduled transfers are so nice. For example, you could have it run automatically every day to check for new files in the source bucket and transfer them to the destination bucket. Alternatively, you could do this with a cron job that runs the gsutil command, but it’s much cleaner to do it this way.</p>
<p>If you have any experience with managing data, then you know that data just keeps growing and growing over time, and if you don’t implement something to keep that growth under control, then you will either run out of storage space or have runaway costs. Since Google Cloud has nearly unlimited storage resources, that means you could easily have runaway costs.</p>
<p>To prevent that, you can use object lifecycle management. There are two ways to control costs using lifecycle management. Based on age, creation time, or number of newer versions, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete objects, or</li>
<li>Move objects to a cheaper storage class, such as Nearline or Coldline Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manage object lifecycle policies through the Cloud Storage console, the “gsutil” command, or the Google API Client Libraries. I’ll show you how to do it with gsutil.</p>
<p>First, you need to create a lifecycle config file that contains the rules you want to set. Here’s an example in JSON format:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“lifecycle”: {</p>
<p> “rule”: [</p>
<p> {</p>
<p>  “action”: {“type”: “Delete”},</p>
<p>  “condition”: {</p>
<p>   “age”: 365,</p>
<p>   “isLive”: true</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p> },</p>
<p> {</p>
<p>  “action”: {“type”: “Delete”},</p>
<p>  “condition”: {</p>
<p>   “isLive”: false,</p>
<p>   “numNewerVersions”: 3</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The first rule says to delete any live object older than 365 days. This might seem like a short time to live, but it’s not as draconian as it looks because it won’t completely delete the object if you’ve enabled versioning on the bucket. It will archive it instead. However, if you don’t have versioning enabled, then a Delete action will completely delete objects matching the condition and there will be no way to get them back. This is why you should test your lifecycle rules on test data before applying them to production data.</p>
<p>The “isLive” parameter only matters if you’ve turned on versioning. If an object is live, it means that it’s the most current version of that object. If it’s not live, then it is one of the archived versions of that object.</p>
<p>Let’s see if versioning is enabled on this bucket. I’ll use the gsutil command to check. It says it’s suspended. What the heck does that mean? It means versioning is disabled. I don’t know why they say suspended instead of disabled.</p>
<p>To enable versioning, we just need to change “get” to “set on”. I have a file in the ca-example bucket called “examplefile” [Show that]. Now, I’ll upload a different version of “examplefile” and see if it archives the old version. OK, it’s uploaded, now I’ll run the “gsutil ls -la” command on that file. Yes, there are two versions of it now and they have different dates and sizes. Note that if you do an “ls -l” without the ‘a’ flag, then it won’t show the different versions, so make sure you include the ‘a’ flag.</p>
<p>OK, let’s get back to the lifecycle policy. The second rule says to delete any object that has at least 3 newer versions of itself, including the live version. Unlike the first rule, this one really will delete the object because when you delete an archived object, it gets deleted forever. Although this rule has an explicit condition that the object must not be live, you don’t actually need to put in that condition because if an object has three newer versions, then it can’t be live. It has to be an archived version.</p>
<p>So, looking at the big picture for these two rules, there are two possible scenarios, depending on whether versioning is enabled or not. If versioning is enabled, then the first rule will archive any object that is more than one year old, and the second rule will delete any object that has at least three newer versions of itself. If versioning is not enabled, then the first rule will delete any object that is more than one year old, and the second rule will not do anything.</p>
<p>Suppose that instead of deleting objects older than one year, you’d like to send them to Nearline Storage, which is significantly cheaper, and send objects in Nearline Storage that are older than 3 years to Coldline Storage, which is even less expensive.</p>
<p>Here’s a lifecycle config file that will implement this policy.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“lifecycle”: {</p>
<p> “rule”: [</p>
<p> {</p>
<p>  “action”: {</p>
<p>   “type”: “SetStorageClass”,</p>
<p>   “storageClass”: “NEARLINE”</p>
<p>  },</p>
<p>  “condition”: {</p>
<p>   “age”: 365,</p>
<p>   “matchesStorageClass”: [“MULTI_REGIONAL”]</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p> },</p>
<p> {</p>
<p>  “action”: {</p>
<p>   “type”: “SetStorageClass”,</p>
<p>   “storageClass”: “COLDLINE”</p>
<p>  },</p>
<p>  “condition”: {</p>
<p>   “age”: 1095,</p>
<p>   “matchesStorageClass”: [“NEARLINE”]</p>
<p>  }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The first rule moves objects that are older than one year from Multi_Regional Storage to Nearline Storage. </p>
<p>The second rule says that if an object is in Nearline Storage and it is at least 1,095 days old (which is 3 years), then it should be moved to Coldline Storage.</p>
<p>To apply this lifecycle policy, you type “gsutil lifecycle set”, then the name of the config file, which is “lc2.json” in this case, and then the URL for the bucket, which is “gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example” in this case. Again, make sure you apply a lifecycle policy to test data before you put it into production or you risk losing valuable data.</p>
<p>Once you’ve set up a lifecycle policy, you can monitor what it’s doing in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expiration time metadata</li>
<li>Access logs</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the metadata for an object, use “gsutil ls -La” on the object. I’ll just show you the first dozen or so lines of the output because it prints all of the access control list information, which we’re not interested in right now. The output from this command may or may not contain expiration time metadata (and it doesn’t for this file), but the lifecycle policy should add that metadata when it knows the date and time that an object will be deleted.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that updates to your lifecycle configuration may take up to 24 hours to go into effect. Not only will it take up to 24 hours before your new rules kick in, but your old rules may still be active for up to 24 hours, so if you discover a mistake in your rules, that bug can still be active for another 24 hours after you fix it, which is another reason why testing your rules on test data first is so important.</p>
<p>Expiration time metadata is useful to see when your lifecycle policy is planning to delete an object, but it won’t show any of the other potential operations, such as moving an object to another storage class. If you want to see all of the operations that your lifecycle policy has actually performed, then you can look at the logs.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already set up access logs for your bucket, then here are the commands you need to use. First create a bucket to hold the logs. Remember to change “ca-example-logs” to your own log bucket name.</p>
<p>gsutil mb gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example-logs</p>
<p>Then you have to give Google Cloud Storage WRITE permission so it can put logs in this bucket.</p>
<p>gsutil acl ch -g <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#45;&#115;&#x74;&#111;&#114;&#x61;&#x67;&#101;&#45;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x79;&#116;&#x69;&#99;&#x73;&#x40;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#x67;&#108;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#45;&#115;&#x74;&#111;&#114;&#x61;&#x67;&#101;&#45;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x79;&#116;&#x69;&#99;&#x73;&#x40;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#x67;&#108;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>:W gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example-logs</p>
<p>Next, you can set the default object ACL to, for example, “project-private”. You don’t have to do this, but it’s a good idea for security purposes to keep your logs private.</p>
<p>gsutil defacl set project-private gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example-logs</p>
<p>And finally, you enable logging with the “gsutil logging set on” command.</p>
<p>gsutil logging set on -b gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example-logs gs:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca-example</p>
<p>Once you have logging set up, then you can go into your logging bucket in the console and the access logs will show up there after the lifecycle policy has made changes.</p>
<p>And that’s it for this lesson.</p>
