          <h1 id="Course-Introduction"><a href="#Course-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course Introduction"></a>Course Introduction</h1><p>Hi and welcome to this Implementing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/what-is-version-control/">Version Control</a> on Azure Repos course. My name is Hallam Webber and I’ll be your instructor for this course. We welcome all comments and feedback, so please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> with any questions or comments.</p>
<p>This is an intermediate level course suited to developers, engineers, and project managers. Having a basic understanding of the software development lifecycle and what’s involved in deploying software to a production environment would be helpful. While most of what I’ll be talking about is theoretical, there will be some demonstrations, so if you want to follow along, you’ll need to have an Azure DevOps account.</p>
<p>I’ll start with an overview of what source control is and the different types of source control. Then, we’ll look at the key elements of branching, different branching strategies, and how they impact the development process. Pull requests and merging is arguably one of the most important repository functions and we will investigate the different merging scenarios available to us. Finally, I’ll take a look at using third-party systems in conjunction with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps.</p>
<p>We welcome all comments and feedback, so please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> with any questions or comments. Let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Version-Control"><a href="#What-is-Version-Control" class="headerlink" title="What is Version Control?"></a>What is Version Control?</h1><p>What is Version Control? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/what-is-version-control/">Version Control</a>, as the name suggests, is a means to manage different versions of your source code, and is also commonly referred to as Source Control. These code versions might be explicit versions of the application, like 1.9 and 2.0, or might be work-in-progress versions, or customized versions for different customers. Managing multiple developers is another key component of Version Control, especially as software teams get bigger, become more numerous as applications become more complex, and those teams are geographically distributed. Implicit in Version Control is maintaining a record of changes to the source code, who made the change, when they made it, and a summary of what the change was. While not an explicit element of Version Control, online code repositories have become synonymous with it and serve as a backup vehicle for source code. As will become apparent, the tree analogy is often used when talking about Version Control. The main thread of the code development is called the trunk, often referred to as the master trunk, while deviations or splits from that are called branches. Because developers aren’t arborists, the master trunk is often called the main branch. This technology isn’t new and falls under two main types, centralized and distributed.</p>
<p>Centralized Version Control systems are modeled on client-server architecture, where developers check out files to work on, much like taking a book out from the library. While the file is checked out, it is locked within the Version Control system, preventing anyone else from making changes to it. This type of Version Control was very much in vogue at the beginning of the century and is represented by well known, if you are of a certain age, products, like CVS, Concurrent Versions Systems, Subversion, and Team Foundation Server, which morphed into Team Foundation Version Control, abbreviated to TFVC. One side-effect of the check-out&#x2F;check-in model is behavioral. Developers tend to put off checking in until their body of work is totally complete as they don’t want to break the build. This leads to large check-ins with associated conflict issues, and makes reverting or unwinding changes more difficult.</p>
<p>Moving forward, distributed systems are very much the flavor of the month now, and if we were to be completely honest when we talk about distributed systems, we are invariably talking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/lets-git-to-the-point/">Git</a>. Instead of checking out and locking files from the master trunk, a developer takes a copy, called a clone, typically of the whole code base, and has it locally, where they can work on any part of it. Obviously, this is a significant advantage over the check-out&#x2F;check-in model when it comes to having multiple developers working on the same code base, especially with remote workers who don’t have to be connected all the time. Changes in the form of branches are typically merged back to the master trunk with what’s called pull requests, which I’ll get into later.</p>
<h1 id="Let’s-Git-to-the-Point"><a href="#Let’s-Git-to-the-Point" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Git to the Point"></a>Let’s Git to the Point</h1><p>Here we see a graphical representation of a typical <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/what-is-version-control/">version control</a> setup with remote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">repositories</a>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps, GitHub, and Bitbucket Cloud are all examples of cloud Git-based remote repositories. A developer with Git installed locally uses Git commands, even if that is via a graphical interface to clone, fetch, fork or pull code from the repository to their local hard drive. They work on the code making changes and saving those changes with accompanying descriptions as commits to their local Git repo. Those commits are then pushed back to the Git structure in the remote repository where they remain until they are merged back into the main trunk through a process called a pull request. A pull request is a process of code review by other developers, preferably two or more followed by a merge operation.</p>
<p>Now I wanna talk about two things that are very closely related, code flow and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/branching-strategy-overview/">branching strategies</a>. It’s a little bit of a chicken or egg situation, but suffice to say that they are interdependent and one impacts the other. Having said that, there are a number of best practices that should be followed no matter what strategy you adopt.</p>
<p>The master trunk should always be bug-free and a facsimile of what is in production. Branches, be they new features, versions, or bug fixes should have meaningful names and be related to a piece of work like new functionality, a work item, or a sprint. Commits should be frequent, relate to one code change and have an accurate and full description.</p>
<p>Now I want to illustrate with a simple and contrived example of why these best practices should be followed. Remember developers are people and have to read, interpret and review code changes before they are released. We want to add a customer search function to our software. First off, we need to add a branch from our known and good and stable master trunk code with a name describing what the branch is about. It’s a new feature called customer search. We could just leave it at that, but in reality, the search is made up of three distinct pieces of functionality.</p>
<p>So we will split that into three branches off the customer search branch. This serves two purposes, firstly keeping each piece of work smaller and more manageable for testing, progress tracking and merging, and secondly if you want different people to work on the pieces simultaneously. Within each of these sub-branches we want work to be committed frequently and often, and I would say that what is illustrated would be the bare minimum. Committing after each piece of logic is completed helps with tracking changes, locating bugs and unwinding code changes if necessary. Each sub-branch is merged back to the customer search branch with a pull request where the code is reviewed.</p>
<p>Not to state the obvious, but reviewing a relatively small piece of code in one or a small handful of files is a relatively simple task as compared with code spread over potentially dozens of files. We’ve ended up with our code reviewed and successfully merged into the customer branch. This is where some of the branching strategies diverge, and I will look at why in the next section. But for simplicity sake, we can now merge our customer search branch back into the master trunk.</p>
<p>What if we didn’t follow these best practices and we created a branch called customer update and assigned the work to a developer? That developer did the work we’ve just talked about and committed all of it to the update branch with the description, customer changes. Then they submitted a pull request to have their code reviewed and merged. Apart from the already mentioned issue of reviewing a larger chunk of code, where’s the history of code changes? If those assigned to review the code don’t have an intimate knowledge of this particular piece of work, they have little in the way of description clues to help them. As I’ve already said, developers are human, so reviewing and merging a relatively large amount of code will greatly increase the possibility of errors. Now, think about that one update branch spread across several developers and then have them merge their work back into the master trunk. In the real world, this scenario would be orders of magnitude bigger in scale and complexity. I really want to hammer home the importance of these simple conventions and how not using them will negate any cleverness you may adopt in your branching strategies.</p>
<h1 id="Branching-Strategy-Overview"><a href="#Branching-Strategy-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Branching Strategy Overview"></a>Branching Strategy Overview</h1><p>One of the criticisms of TFVC, a centralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">repository</a> system, is that branching is expensive. What does this actually mean? Well, the cost of branching can be viewed in two ways. There is the cost of performing the branching process and there is the cost of merging the branch back into the master trunk. Creating a branch in TFVC isn’t as easy as with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/lets-git-to-the-point/">Git</a>, and this is mainly due to the fact that TFVC creates a physical copy of the original branch as the starting point of the new branch, whereas Git uses the most recent commit from the parent branch. It’s the difference between making a physical copy of a variable, as opposed to creating a new pointer to it. The other crucial difference is that TFVC branches are always created on the server, so you have to be connected and be cognizant of branch naming and potential naming conflicts. As Git is distributed, a developer can create branches at will on their own repository and only have to be concerned when merging back to the remote branch.</p>
<p>Merging brings us to the second cost of branching, which significantly outweighs the first. Everyone involved in software development will have their own horror story of branch merging, which typically revolves around sorting out code differences between two or more versions of the same file, or files. Sure, there are tools that can help with this, but it is essentially a manual process similar to untangling string. The process is how long and how many pieces of string are there? This leads to the often quoted refrain “Branch less, merge more,” and is the main underlying conundrum of branching strategies.</p>
<p>Having said that, let’s look at some generic branching scenarios starting with Main Only, which is essentially a branchless strategy, that is just the master trunk. This means all work is committed back to the main trunk or branch. The Main Only strategy has limited application. It is not suited to maintaining multiple versions and would be very difficult to manage with many developers working on multiple features. Labels can be used to mark development and release events. The irony is that Trunk-based branching, that we’ll look at later, is closely related to Main Only and is gaining substantial traction as a strategy.</p>
<p>Development isolation is one of the strategies most people think of when talking about branching. The central tenet of branching is to maintain a stable and pristine main branch, and development isolation does this by explicitly separating all development into its own dev branch. You end up with two branches running in parallel. When a feature in the dev branch is complete, it is merged back into the main branch. When a bug is discovered in production code, it is fixed in the main branch and merged into the dev branch. It seems like a good strategy, but you’ve essentially ended up with two versions of the software truth, and quite some effort is required to maintain concurrency. It’s definitely not unheard of for bug fixes in the main branch not to be merged into dev and then for the bug to reappear after a new dev feature is merged into main.</p>
<p>Feature isolation is a variant or evolution of development isolation. Basically, its short-lived development branches that are dedicated to one feature. This addresses a couple of issues. Firstly, “The branch only exists, “or should only exist for a short time “before it’s merged back into its parent.” A feature can be branched off a development branch. Secondly, there can be multiple feature branches running concurrently. When it comes to bug fixes in production, there is still the same issue of fixing them in the master and merging them into the feature branch so they aren’t lost when merging features back.</p>
<p>Release isolation is geared towards creating multiple production versions of your software as each release branch is a snapshot of the code when the branch is created. Release branches can coexist with development or feature branches. When you want to release a new version of your software because the required features have been completed, tested and merged back into master, you create a release branch. The release branch is read-only, with one exception. If a bug is found in production code, it is fixed in the release branch and merged back into the main branch. This is a simplistic depiction, as there can be multiple concurrent releases in existence and being supported. In terms of applying hotfixes to past releases, it really boils down to how long you want to support old versions before retiring them. This is probably a good place to remind ourselves of how different software platforms have different requirements. In the world of web or mobile apps, it’s very rare to have more than one version of your software in the wild. Everyone runs the latest version. This is certainly not the case for desktop or server-based applications and will definitely influence your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/the-strategies/">branching strategy</a> choice.</p>
<h1 id="The-Strategies"><a href="#The-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="The Strategies"></a>The Strategies</h1><p>Okay, now on to the strategies. As you may have guessed, these strategies have more in common than their differences, but while differences are subtle, they are important especially when it comes to how your organization manages code flow and the development process.</p>
<p>GitHub Flow is the archetypal <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/branching-strategy-overview/">branching strategy</a>, and pretty much what I described in the Got commitment, or should be committed slide. In GitHub flow, the master branch is always deployable and should reflect what is in production. Any new work is created in a branch off master. Regularly commit to that branch locally and push to that branch on the server. When the branch is ready or finished, open a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/pull-requests-and-merging/">pull request</a> for the code to be reviewed. This can also be done when you need help, feedback, or a second opinion on the code. Once the branch has been reviewed and tested, it can be deployed into production. If the deployed branch causes issues or has bugs, it can be rolled back by deploying the existing master. Otherwise, the branch can be merged with master.</p>
<p>Next, we have Gitflow, which has, for all intents and purposes, two main branches. The master branch is stable code that reflects what is deployed in production. The development branch is the parent branch of most code changes. When a change is required, a branch is created from the development branch. These branches can be categorized as feature branches, branched from development merged to development, release branches, branched from development merged to master and development, and hotfix branches, branched from master merged to master and development. A development branch becomes like a master branch for a set of features. When a feature is finished, it is merged back to the development branch. To deploy the new functionality, a release branch is created from the development branch. The release branch, typically named as the release <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">version</a> number, including any bug fixes and tweaks, is merged back into development and master branches after the release is deployed. If a critical bug is discovered in the live application that can’t wait for the next release, a hotfix is required. A hotfix is branched off master and merged back into master as well as development, so both code threads get the fix.</p>
<p>Forking, or fork and pull. This strategy is typically found in public projects where you want to use an existing code base as the starting point for your project. A developer will clone the original repository to their own remote repository, creating a new origin master branch. When forking a project, it is implied that you won’t be trying to merge your changes back to the original.</p>
<p>Now for something completely different. Well, maybe not completely, but significantly. Release flow is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps’ internal take on Trunk Based Development, and where the line between branching strategies and code flow blurs. As the name implies, all branches, be they features, bugs or hotfixes, are branched directly off the master trunk. Where Release Flow diverges from traditional trunk-based models is how and when the code is deployed. This strategy puts emphasis on the release schedule, which is tied to deploying at the end of each sprint. The strategy is designed around workflow, adhering to continuous integration and deployment processes, and projects at scale. In terms of workflow, it fits with the sprint schedule, but the main reason to do this, as the sprints usually don’t correspond to any one feature branch, is the time taken to do the actual deployment. There are literally hundreds of developers working on hundreds of branches at any one time. It is totally impractical to have deployments dictated by feature branch completion, as developers would spend too much time waiting for their queued release to be deployed before continuing with the next feature.</p>
<p>The first issue that comes to mind when looking at this graphic is how does it deal with half-completed features at the time of release deployment? Well, they use feature flags to turn off incomplete functionality within the code. If you are unfamiliar with feature flags, in its most elementary form, it is conditional branching around some code. That is, if the feature is enabled, show it, else don’t. It can be a lot more sophisticated in terms of conditions to be evaluated, but that’s it in a nutshell. The other issue is hotfixes. These are done on the main branch and then cherry-picked into the release branch.</p>
<p>The release flow strategy follows some strict conventions due to scale and working directly off the master trunk. Branch naming follows the convention of user name, then branch type, followed by description, although this has more to do with the number of developers. The development or topic branches need to be as small as possible, so work is broken down into its smallest logical functional units. This serves two purposes. It makes reviewing and testing much easier and quicker, while limiting damage if something does go wrong. And it’s no surprise that testing is very important when merging straight back to the master trunk. Each feature branch is tested as if it was going into production before merging back to master, because in essence, it is.</p>
<h1 id="Pull-Requests-and-Merging"><a href="#Pull-Requests-and-Merging" class="headerlink" title="Pull Requests and Merging"></a>Pull Requests and Merging</h1><p>You can’t talk about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">version control</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/the-strategies/">branching</a> without talking about pull requests and merging. This is where the branching rubber meets the road and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps supports several merging strategies; basic merge, squash merge, rebase and fast-forward, and rebase with merge commit.</p>
<p>Your basic merge command is for integrating changes from one branch to another, and by default, Azure DevOps uses the git merge command with the no fast-forward option. No fast-forward creates a commit on the target branch of the merge, let’s say the main branch when merging a feature branch, and that commit contains the history of commits up to that point, so very helpful in terms of seeing how the development evolved. In contrast, a fast-forward merge is only possible when there is no divergence between the branches. This means there is nothing in the main branch code that isn’t in the feature branch.</p>
<p>A squash merge takes the commits of the branch in question, say a feature branch with three commits, and condenses or squashes the contents of those commits into one commit on the target branch of the merge. In general, commit messages should clearly define the intent of the change and make sense when viewed in isolation, but too often, this isn’t the case. The squash merge commit is a way to summarize the intent and function of a branch without all of its commit baggage. As the branch being merged is essentially discarded, the commit history is linear.</p>
<p>Rebasing is taking your branch and repositioning it at the end of its parent branch. Doing this effectively eliminates any divergence between the two branches, so a fast-forward merge can be performed to make the tip of the child branch now the tip of the parent, that is the child becomes an extension of the parent including its commit history. Like squash merge, this keeps the commit history linear, but also preserves individual commits.</p>
<p>Finally, we have rebase with a no fast-forward merge commit. The pull request commits are rebased to the end of the parent branch, then a no fast-forward merge is performed. Fundamentally, this is the same as the rebase with fast-forward merge, except branching and merging are immediately obvious when viewing the development history.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Work-Items-and-Branching-in-Azure-DevOps"><a href="#DEMO-Work-Items-and-Branching-in-Azure-DevOps" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Work Items and Branching in Azure DevOps"></a>DEMO: Work Items and Branching in Azure DevOps</h1><p>Let’s see how <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps can help to integrate workflow with branching. I’m gonna go from my Repo to Work Items under the Board’s menu and create a new feature work item. I’ll give it a descriptive name and assign it to myself. Next, I’ll link it to another work item as a child. This involves adding a link to related work. The link relationship is apparent and the item is the user story list, service, and DBs. Now I’ll save the work item. And what I should’ve done was linked the work item to a branch. Let’s go back and do that. Under Add Link in the Development on the right, click on Create a Branch link and link an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">Azure Repo</a>. Give the branch a meaningful name and select which branch you want to branch off. Click Create Branch, and you’ll be taken to the branch in the Repo. As I’ve mentioned, code reviews as part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/pull-requests-and-merging/">pull requests</a> are an important aspect of the merge process. Azure DevOps lets you enforce some conditions of code approval through branch policies. Research has shown that the minimum number of approvers should be at least two, and of course, that should be excluding the pull requester. We can prevent the requester from approving their own changes and stipulate that all reviewers must approve the change and all comments be resolved. We can also specify that a pull request must be associated with at least one work item to aid project management and traceability. Limit merge types, lets us specify which type of branch merging we will allow with pull requests. I want to make sure there’s absolutely no loss of historical fidelity, and all merge actions are clearly identifiable. So, I will not allow squash or rebase and fast-forward mergers. After saving the policy, we can see the branch’s small badge icon next to it indicating a policy has been set.</p>
<h1 id="Setting-Access-Permissions-on-Repositories"><a href="#Setting-Access-Permissions-on-Repositories" class="headerlink" title="Setting Access Permissions on Repositories"></a>Setting Access Permissions on Repositories</h1><p>When it comes to managing access to or setting permissions on a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">version control</a> system, the granularity of permissions is split down centralized versus distributed lines. In a nutshell, centralized systems let you, with differing degrees of ease, set permissions right down to the file level, while distributed systems typically only go as far as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-work-items-and-branching-in-azure-devops/">branch</a>. When I say differing degrees of ease, I’m not joking. Team Foundation Version Control has a graphical interface, while Subversion uses a combination of configuration files and specialized authentication modules. Apache Subversion requires you to load the mod_auth_svn module and use the AuthsSVNAccessFile directive, specifying a file with the required access rules. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-setting-permissions-in-azure-devops-tvfc/">access permission</a> file can have sections with the repository name followed by the branch and path, and of course, the path can be a file name followed by users or groups and whether they can read and or write to the path.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Setting-Permissions-in-Azure-DevOps-TFVC"><a href="#DEMO-Setting-Permissions-in-Azure-DevOps-TFVC" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Setting Permissions in Azure DevOps TFVC"></a>DEMO: Setting Permissions in Azure DevOps TFVC</h1><p>If I go into this TFVC project on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps and go into project settings, I can select <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">Repositories</a> under Repos. The first thing that becomes apparent is the number of actions on which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/setting-access-permissions-on-repositories/">permissions</a> can be set. This is not just read and write permissions. In the right-hand security pane, we can see the groups and users listed. If you can’t find a particular group or user just start typing their name in the search box. I’ve brought up the user Hallam Sql and can see he has inherited the ability to perform all the actions on the DAL folder from the main branch. I’ll deny him check-in and merge on the folder. Now if I go to the ICostCentres file I can see the inherited permissions, but I’m going to allow him to check-in and merge just this file. I can see the other files still have the inherited permissions.</p>
<h1 id="Distributed-Repository-Permissions"><a href="#Distributed-Repository-Permissions" class="headerlink" title="Distributed Repository Permissions"></a>Distributed Repository Permissions</h1><p>If we look at Distributed Repository Permissions, and by distributed, I really mean Git-based systems, we don’t have any ability to specify actions at the file level. The default <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-setting-permissions-in-azure-devops-tvfc/">permissions</a> for these systems is allow access that has access is either allowed or not specified. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps actions have two effective permissions, allow and deny, plus not set, Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub Enterprise, both have read, write, and admin in common. GitHub Enterprise also adds triaged permissions for managing issues and pull requests without write access and maintain permission for managing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">repositories</a> without the ability to access destructive or sensitive actions. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-setting-permissions-in-azure-devops-git/">GitHub</a> Enterprise Actions presented here are by no means exhaustive, but represent those most applicable to repositories. It’s clear looking at the wording of Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub Enterprise branch actions that they are restrictions on the default project and repository permissions.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Setting-Permissions-in-Azure-DevOps-Git"><a href="#DEMO-Setting-Permissions-in-Azure-DevOps-Git" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Setting Permissions in Azure DevOps Git"></a>DEMO: Setting Permissions in Azure DevOps Git</h1><p>Let’s see how the Git variant of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">repo</a> permissions work. As with the earlier TFVC repo, go to project settings and click repositories under repos. I’ll go to the repository and allow Hallam Sql to bypass policies when pushing to the repo. We can see that permission has been propagated down to the branches. Now for some inexplicable sadistic reason, I will deny him the ability on the list server DBs, and DB select with tree view branches while leaving that permission intact for the master branch. Whatever your motivation, these <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/distributed-repository-permissions/">permissions</a> at repo or branch level will allow you to bypass for individuals or groups, any branch policies you have implemented.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Not-Using-an-Azure-Repo"><a href="#DEMO-Not-Using-an-Azure-Repo" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Not Using an Azure Repo?"></a>DEMO: Not Using an Azure Repo?</h1><p>Before there were <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-setting-permissions-in-azure-devops-git/">Azure DevOps Git</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">repos</a>, there were just Git repos. And as you would expect, they function identically. So it’s very easy to integrate a non-Azure Repository with an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> Pipeline. When you create your pipeline, just select the appropriate provider from where is your code. Next, select your repository and supply your credentials. Once the pipeline is configured, you’ll be able to run it, pulling the code from the Vanilla GitHub repository. As we set this up using the Wizard, we’re still none the wiser about the mechanism for connecting to the GitHub repo. If I go into project settings and then into service connections, I can see the connection to github.com. Drilling down into it, we can see the authentication details. Alternatively, you may want to import a GitHub repo to your Azure DevOps project. This is easily done by going to your projects repo and under files, select import repository from the repo drop-down list. As I’ve already authenticated with GitHub, I’m not asked to provide my credentials and the import goes ahead.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Third-Party-Pipeline"><a href="#DEMO-Third-Party-Pipeline" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Third-Party Pipeline"></a>DEMO: Third-Party Pipeline</h1><p>What if you’re using or want to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">Azure DevOps</a> but you have all your build pipelines set up on another platform like Jenkins? This scenario is easy enough to set up from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps point of view. We can create a service hook trigger that will initiate the build process in a Jenkins pipeline.</p>
<p>First, let’s see the process in action. I’ve got a .NET Core web app with source code in an Azure DevOps repo, and I’ve set up a service hook connection to a Jenkins instance running on an Azure VM. Azure has a pre-configured Jenkins VM service that is easy to spin up and comes preloaded with the necessary Azure plugins. You can go directly to Jenkins and download the software, but you will have to install the Azure plugins yourself, which isn’t a big deal. When I commit a change, a build will be kicked off. We can see that in action over on the Jenkins pipeline view.</p>
<p>Now that the deployment is completed we can see my commit comment is listed under changes and if we drill down into the details it shows what files have been changed. Going back to Azure DevOps, we can see the commit that triggered the build process. To set up the service hook, go to Project Settings under General and click service hooks and click the new service hook plus button. Select the service, in this case Jenkins. Just for ease of demonstration, I’ll select code pushed as the trigger in this repository.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll fill in the Jenkins detail section. With the Azure end set up, let’s go back to Jenkins and see how the integration looks from there. This is a pipeline build with parameters, with the most important parameter being the Azure Service Principal credentials. The actual pipeline code is pretty straight forward, We check out the code from the Azure DevOps repository. If the repository is private we need to supply credentials and wrap the Git command in with credentials using Azure Service Principal.</p>
<p>Next is the publish stage, which is a script calling .net. This is running on a Linux Box so it is called with a shell script command. On Windows, this would be a batch command. Finally, we deploy with azureWebAppPublish using our service principal credential parameter, resource group parameter, and an app name parameter. The source directory is where the built code can be found. The key to this process is the service principal credentials, so let’s have a look at that under Jenkins credentials. Subscription, client, and tenant IDs are those of the registered app under Azure Active Directory, and the client secret is the secret associated with that app registration.</p>
<p>Remember to give permissions to access Azure DevOps under API permissions so you can pull code from a private repository. If you have all of these details correctly entered into Jenkins but are getting an invalid subscription message, the chances are you haven’t set up the correct role assignments for your service principal.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/course-introduction/">course</a>, we’ve seen how the differences between centralized version control systems like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/demo-setting-permissions-in-azure-devops-tvfc/">TFVC</a> in distributed Git-based systems impacts multiple and remote teams, and how these different architectures deal with access permissions. I think it’s fair to say that Git and its derivatives are the preeminent systems at this time, and the main reason for this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/branching-strategy-overview/">branching</a>.</p>
<p>Branching is technically easy and often referred to as cheap in comparison with centralized systems equivalence. While branching may be quick and easy, as with everything in life, there are no free lunches and all branches must end up being merged back into the main or master trunk in the end. This merge date must be repaid through the pull request mechanism. This is where we see how our different branching strategies evolved to lighten this burden.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all software projects organizations are the same and they have different needs, but what I find interesting is how branching models proliferated, became more complex, and convoluted, but we’re always hamstrung by the same basic issue; merging. In this new automated DevOps world, this very important, but potentially manually intensive task is a real fly in the ointment. I like how the release flow strategy goes back to basics, which is trunk-based development off the master branch, but with a twist of using feature flags to isolate incomplete work. This method addresses one of the key pain points by keeping branches as short as possible and related to just one feature or function. Of course, no branching strategy is a silver bullet and the release flow only fulfills its promise with a rigorous testing on branches before the pull request.</p>
<p>There are always going to be situations where you need to revert changes and this is sometimes referred to in complex situations like trying to get the sugar out of your coffee. Smaller branches merged more often can definitely minimize the associated grief in this situation. The bottom line is that all strategies are conventions using the same tools and is up to you to settle on a strategy that best works for you. Having said that, repository systems do offer mechanisms to enforce best practices or the strategy you have decided to adopt.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps, branch policies can enforce proper behavior within <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-version-control-on-azure-repos-1049/pull-requests-and-merging/">pull requests</a> by requiring a minimum number of approvers, for example. Branch policies also allow you to enforce particular merging strategies. Finally, we took a look at integrating third-party repositories with Azure DevOps pipelines and how to integrate Azure DevOps repos with a Jenkin build pipeline. It turns out we’re spoiled for choice with version control systems and it’s just a case of finding which one is most easily adapted to your situation.</p>

Oddly enough these two metrics are typically viewed as polar opposites. Generally speaking the faster an application is typically rolled out, the lower the quality of that app. The higher the quality of the app, the longer the development cycle. However, by leveraging <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps processes, developers can identify issues sooner which in turn usually means that they can fix them sooner. The list that you see on your screen shows key metrics that directly relate to the quality of the code being produced, as well as the quality of the build and deployment process. Failed builds percentage refers to the overall percentage of builds that are failing, while failed deployments percentage refers to the overall percentage of deployments that are failing. Ticket volume is the total volume of customer and bug tickets. The bug bounds percentage refers to the percentage of customer or bug tickets that are being reopened. Lastly, the unplanned work percentage refers to the percentage of the overall work being performed that’s unplanned. Taking stock of these key metrics allows you to more easily identify and recommend quality metrics in your development environment.</p>

<h1 id="Feature-Flags"><a href="#Feature-Flags" class="headerlink" title="Feature Flags"></a>Feature Flags</h1><p>Hi there, let’s talk a little bit about feature flags. Feature flags are used to change how things work. Instead of making significant changes to the actual code within an app, you only need to make a small configuration change, and more often than not, this configuration change will only be necessary for a small number of users.</p>
<p>Leveraging feature flags provides an elegant solution when you would otherwise need to deploy new code into trunk, but not yet have it functional. Feature flags are typically implemented as the value of variables which are then used to control conditional logic.</p>
<p>The best way to explain feature flags is to use an example. So let’s imagine a scenario where your team is working in the main trunk branch of an e-commerce application. Your manager has come to you and asked if it makes more sense to have the shipping cost calculations performed in the main branch instead of dealing with the messy operations of merge later on. How do you try this out without making wholesale changes to the app or, worse yet, breaking the app altogether?</p>
<p>In this case, you could use a feature flag to get around this. What you could do in this case is make a small change in your code so that users without the feature flag set continue using the original shipping calculation code while your team members who are working on the new shipping calculation code and who have the feature flag set see the new code that’s being created.</p>
<p>This scenario would be an example of how to use a business feature flag which is used to determine business logic. The other type of feature flag is known as a release flag.</p>
<p>Now to demonstrate the use of a release flag, let’s build upon our previous example. Let’s assume your team has completed its work on the shipping calculation code. While you’re pretty confident in your team’s work you might be a little bit apprehensive about pushing this new code out to all of your users at once. In this case you’d rather push out the changes to a group of users that’s better at dealing with new code and the issues that sometimes arise from that new code. This type of group consists of users that are referred to as canaries. The term canary comes from the old use of canaries in coal mines.</p>
<p>What you would do in this case is change the configuration so that your canary users also have the feature flag set. As a result they can start testing the new code as well while the original code continues to function for all other users. If things go south for the canary users you can quickly disable the flag for them so they can go back to using the original code.</p>
<p>So now that you’ve been introduced to feature flags in general, let’s talk a little bit about their life cycle. The minute you use a feature flag for the first time, that feature flag gets added to the overall technical debt that you need to contend with. That in mind you need to realize that the longer a particular flag hangs around as part of your code, the bigger that technical debt becomes.</p>
<p>As you continue to add more and more feature flags to the code, that code becomes more and more complex. Ultimately you wind up with code that’s more difficult to test than it needs to be and it’s harder to maintain due to its complexity. This often makes it more difficult to troubleshoot because it becomes harder and harder to duplicate problems as part of that troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>To avoid these types of issues, you really need to remove unneeded feature flags as soon as you can. Developing a plan for managing your feature flag life cycle helps accomplish this. As soon as a flag is added to your code you need to have a plan for when it’s going to be removed.</p>
<p>I should also point out that you should never repurpose feature flags. This is a big no-no because it opens you up to the possibility of using a flag for a new purpose even though that flag is still part of your code for its original purpose. This can cause all kinds of serious headaches.</p>
<p>To effectively manage the life cycle for your feature flags, start by making sure that you know which flags exist. You should also be keeping track of which feature flags are enabled in which environments. You should also, of course, have a plan for when your flags will be used in production and when they will be removed.</p>
<p>Implementing a feature flag management system such as this allows you to reap the benefits of those flags while keeping your technical debt to a minimum.</p>

<h1 id="Technical-Debt"><a href="#Technical-Debt" class="headerlink" title="Technical Debt"></a>Technical Debt</h1><p>Welcome to technical debt. In this lecture, we’re going to talk a little bit about what technical debt is and how to manage it.</p>
<p>Technical debt refers to the future costs that will be incurred when you decide to deploy an easy solution rather than one that’s grounded in best practices. it’s essentially the price you pay for bypassing best practices because deploying them takes longer to complete.</p>
<p>The term technical debt is used because of its similarity to financial debt. Think about it. A person who is in debt is often in debt because he often makes decisions that only consider the now. However, over time, interest accrues. As that interest accrues it gets harder and harder for that person to manage that debt in the future. Fewer and fewer options are then available to him. This snowball effect isn’t much different from the snowball effect that occurs when developers make decisions without any regard for the future. Just like financial debt, technical debt will snowball to the point where developers wind up spending most of their time troubleshooting problems and doing rework. This prevents them from adding much value to the project and to the organization in general.</p>
<p>Increased technical debt is often blamed on tight deadlines because if a developer is forced to throw together code quickly he’s often going to take shortcuts, it’s only natural. For example, a developer who is under the gun to add new features to an application might simply make a copy of a specific piece of code and then edit it rather than refactoring the original method to include the new functionality. This faster way of completing the task allows the developer to only have to test the new code. He can also avoid the more stringent testing that would probably be required if he refactored the original method because it’s going to be used by other parts of the code.</p>
<p>While this strategy does meet the deadline, it results in a longer-term problem because there are now two different copies of the same code that will need to be managed and maintained going forward. This increases the risk of the app logic diverging.</p>
<p>Other causes of technical debt include a lack of technical skills, a lack of product direction or ownership, or maybe an organization with no defined coding standards at all. Regardless, at the end of the day, technical debt is a main cause of projects that fail to meet their deadlines.</p>
<p>Because of the impact that technical debt has on delivery and maintenance of solutions, it’s critical that you integrate the assessment and measurement of technical debt and of code quality as part of your continuous integration and deployment pipelines in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps.</p>
<p>By building in support for things like Sonar Cloud to an Azure DevOps pipeline, you can leverage it to analyze your code. This allows you to drill down into issues that are identified. As a result, you can see what the issues are along with suggested remedies. You can even view estimates of the time that’s required to apply each remedy.</p>

<h1 id="Team-Structures"><a href="#Team-Structures" class="headerlink" title="Team Structures"></a>Team Structures</h1><p>Welcome to team structures. In this brief lecture, we’re going to look at the differences between horizontal teams and vertical teams. Reorganizing to be agile is often difficult for organizations. Doing so often requires a shift in culture that runs counter to many existing policies and processes that may already be in place within the organization.</p>
<p>This often occurs because governance requirements within these organizations, especially the larger ones, usually result in lots of rigid rules and operating structures. Delegation of authority is usually very narrow as well because most large organizations haven’t yet moved to an agile structure they often have difficulty coping with change. To avoid being disrupted by startups, established organizations must rethink their team structures.</p>
<p>More traditional horizontal team structures split teams up according to the software architecture. For example, an organization’s teams might be organized into user interface, service-oriented architecture, and data. By contrast, this same organization could also be broken up into a vertical team structure. This vertical structure could span the architecture and it could be aligned with product outcomes instead. Generally speaking, a vertical team structure such as the one you see in this example often results in better outcomes in agile projects. In such a structure it’s critical that each project have a clearly identified owner. The vertical team structure also allows for easier scaling. This is made possible because to scale, all an organization needs to do is add teams. In this example you see on your screen additional feature teams have been created to scale out. The key takeaway here is that vertical teams are often a better strategy versus horizontal teams when trying to become agile.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Testing"><a href="#Performance-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Performance Testing"></a>Performance Testing</h1><p>Hi there, welcome to performance testing. Over the next few minutes we’re going to look at some strategies for planning and implementing performance testing. Because users are sensitive to slow or malfunctioning applications, organizations need to ensure that they are incorporating performance testing and load testing procedures as part of the building and deployment of applications.</p>
<p>While quick deployment of applications and solutions is important, what’s even more important is the ability to deliver well-designed and while performing solutions that provide value to the end-users and to the organization.</p>
<p>Before talking about performance testing, it’s important to understand the difference between performance testing and load testing. This is because performance testing is often confused with load testing but these are really two different concepts. Performance testing is used to see how responsive an application is, how stable it is, and how efficiently it uses the resources that are assigned to it. While load testing is used to test an application’s performance when it’s run under a load.</p>
<p>While it’s expected that an organization’s testing team should focus on features when designing a solution, it should also be noted that performance is in many ways a feature itself.</p>
<p>A common issue that organizations often run into is that more often than not performance testing only enters the equation after the development team is comfortable with the stability of the code. However, what should be happening is that the organization’s performance testers should start running new code as soon as it’s available. What this does is ensure feedback makes its way back to the developers sooner rather than later. This allows the developers to more quickly rectify issues.</p>
<p>During performance testing you should be looking at how long user actions take to complete within an application. You should also be working out how much load the solution can handle before things start going south. This might require you to identify where the bottlenecks are as the number of users increases or as the size of the data grows. You may also want to ensure that the application or solution can run for long periods of time without issues like memory leaks which can cause performance degradation.</p>
<p>That all being said it’s important to utilize automated testing tools to perform this testing because it’s impractical to perform any sort of meaningful performance testing or to integrate within a DevOps pipeline without a suite of automation tools.</p>
<p>Simply compiling a list of tools that you plan to use in your performance testing activities is not a plan. I mean sure it’s a good idea but there’s more involved. You need to also sort out how you’re going to configure your testing environment and what testing processes you’re going to use. You’ll also need to define success and failure. What will success look like? What will failure look like?</p>
<p>There are also several questions that you need to answer. You’ll need to understand the expectations of the business and the expectations of the target users. When creating a performance testing plan you’ll also need to define the metrics that you plan to measure.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s critical that performance testing be included in your planning right from the start. If you’ll be using a Kanban board it might be a good idea to have a space near it that can be used to plan out your testing strategy. Any gaps in your testing strategy should be highlighted during iteration planning and you should also sort out how you plan to monitor performance once a solution has been deployed.</p>

<h1 id="Inspecting-amp-Validating-Code-Base-for-Compliance"><a href="#Inspecting-amp-Validating-Code-Base-for-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Inspecting &amp; Validating Code Base for Compliance"></a>Inspecting &amp; Validating Code Base for Compliance</h1><p>Hi there, welcome back. In this lecture, we’re going to dive into inspection and validation of code base for compliance. Despite the importance of data security. with every new day, it seems a new story about another data breach pops up. Whether it’s credit card data being stolen, website logins being hacked, or other personal data that’s stolen it’s a problem.</p>
<p>So what’s happening?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that organizations need to protect information from people that shouldn’t have access to it, however, they also need to make sure that customer information isn’t altered or destroyed when it shouldn’t be. On the flipside, organizations also need to ensure that data is destroyed when it’s supposed to be. Users need to be properly authenticated before getting access to data and those users need to have the proper permissions to do so. Using historical data archive data and logs should allow organizations to track down evidence when something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Building secure applications is a big part of security however it can be difficult to do this. While you may find it surprising many developers and other IT professionals assume that they understand security. In reality, they really don’t. This is because the entire cyber security discipline is always evolving, which is not unlike any other IT discipline. That being the case ongoing education and training is critical.</p>
<p>When developing secure applications it’s important that you ensure that the code is created correctly and that it securely implements any features that are required. On top of that you need to ensure that the features themselves are designed with security in mind. This doesn’t always happen.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to make sure that when you’re developing an application that the application is compliant with any special rules or regulations that it needs to comply with. It’s important to test for this compliance during the build process and to retest periodically after deployment. This is because it’s often rather difficult to shoehorn security into an application after the fact.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, it’s important to recognize that secure development needs to be a part of every stage of the software development lifecycle. It’s even more critical for applications that process sensitive or highly confidential information.</p>
<p>With the introduction of DevOps practices, it’s now much easier for developers to integrate security testing into the app development pipeline. What this does is create an environment where security testing is part of the day-to-day delivery process rather than something that needs to be performed by security specialists after the fact.</p>

<h1 id="Inspecting-amp-Validating-Infrastructure-for-Compliance"><a href="#Inspecting-amp-Validating-Infrastructure-for-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Inspecting &amp; Validating Infrastructure for Compliance"></a>Inspecting &amp; Validating Infrastructure for Compliance</h1><p>Hi there, welcome back. In this lecture, we’re going to look at strategies for inspecting and validating your infrastructure for compliance. More specifically we’ll take a look at PowerShell desired state configuration, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> Automation State Configuration, and InSpec.</p>
<p>Some time ago automating the creation of resources was done largely through procedural code that was written in languages like PowerShell. While this methodology does work, it doesn’t make it easy for developers to write idempotent code which is code that produces the same outcome no matter how many times you run it.</p>
<p>When PowerShell desired state configuration became available it was a huge improvement. Using DSC you could define a desired outcome instead of creating the process for achieving that outcome. DSC was a declarative way to automate the configuration and compliance of resources rather than a procedural way.</p>
<p>There are now several tools available that allow you to define infrastructure as code. These tools provide lots of benefits to DevOps teams because the tools allow those DevOps teams to now build reliable environments on demand and in a repeatable way. Such environments can even include operating systems and services. Teams can run the same code over and over again to ensure that the target state is not only present to begin with but to also remove any drift from that desired state.</p>
<p>Now all that being said in addition to configuration of environments there is also a need to validate those environments.</p>
<p>Azure Automation State Configuration is a validation tool that builds on PowerShell DSC. It makes management easier by allowing you to author and manage DSC configurations and to import DSC resources. You can also use Azure Automation State Configuration to generate DSC node configurations or MOF documents. These DSC configurations and MOF documents are then placed on an automation server. Target nodes which can be located in the cloud or on-prem can retrieve them from the automation server. The target nodes will then automatically conform to the desired state and report their compliance state back to that automation server.</p>
<p>InSpec is another validation tool. It’s an open-source testing framework for infrastructure. It features a language for specifying compliance, security, and other policy requirements. InSpec compares the current state of a system with the desired state that you define within the InSpec code. The tool will then go out and identify violations, displaying its findings in a report.</p>
<p>However, unlike Azure Automation State Configuration, remediations of issues identified by InSpec is performed by the administrator.</p>

<h1 id="Secure-Development-amp-Coding"><a href="#Secure-Development-amp-Coding" class="headerlink" title="Secure Development &amp; Coding"></a>Secure Development &amp; Coding</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Secure Development and Coding. Secure development starts with secure coding practices. The Open Web Application Security Project, otherwise known as OWASP, is a global organization that focuses on improving the security of software. The stated mission of OWASP is to raise the visibility of software security, so that users can make informed decisions. As a charitable organization, OWASP provides impartial advice that is practical.</p>
<p>OWASP regularly publishes its set of Secure Coding Practices, which provides guidelines that govern things like Input Validation, Output Encoding, and Authentication and Password Management. Other areas covered by these guidelines include Session Management, Access Control, and Cryptographic Practices, among others.</p>
<p>OWASP also publishes an intentionally vulnerable web application that can be used to learn about common vulnerabilities. It’s called The Juice Shop Tool Project and it includes all kinds of vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 103.</p>
<p>To learn more about the OWASP Foundation, visit the URL that you see on your screen. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://owasp.org/">http://owasp.org</a>. You can also download the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide from their website as well.</p>

<h1 id="Infrastructure-Security-Validation-Tools-amp-Practices"><a href="#Infrastructure-Security-Validation-Tools-amp-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Infrastructure Security Validation Tools &amp; Practices"></a>Infrastructure Security Validation Tools &amp; Practices</h1><p>Hi there, welcome to infrastructure security validation tools and practices. When it comes to checking for vulnerabilities you can’t just validate your applications. You need to also validate your infrastructure to check for vulnerabilities especially when you’re leveraging public cloud resources like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a>. You need to ensure that anything you deploy in these types of public cloud environments is deployed securely.</p>
<p>A robust strategy for performing infrastructure security validation requires a full suite of tools and practices. Azure tools that you can use to prevent and report on vulnerabilities include things like Security Center and Azure policies. However, you should also set up a scanner as part of your network pipeline that checks public endpoints and ports and ensures that they’ve been added to an allow list or a whitelist. If the scanner finds an endpoint or port that hasn’t been whitelisted the scanner should raise an infrastructure issue or create a bug.</p>
<p>More specifically after your scan’s complete, your Azure pipelines release should be updated with a report that shows the results of these scans. Bugs should then be created in the team’s backlog so they can be addressed.</p>
<p>By building a scanner into your pipeline, vulnerabilities are recorded as bugs. These bugs provide actionable work which you can then track and measure.</p>
<p>Now even if you build in continuous security validation in this manner and you’re running scans and checks against every change to ensure known vulnerabilities aren’t being introduced, newer vulnerabilities are always being discovered because the bad guys are always changing their strategies. This is where monitoring can help. A solid monitoring tool helps you detect, prevent, and remediate issues that are discovered while your applications running in production. Microsoft Azure offers several tools that provide detection, prevention, and alerting, based on rules like the OWASP top ten.</p>
<p>The best way to effectively minimize security vulnerabilities is to take a holistic and layered approach to security. This means that you need to secure the infrastructure and the application architecture. You also need to perform continuous validation and monitoring.</p>
<p>Following DevSecOps practices and standards allows your team to incorporate all the necessary security capabilities into the entire lifecycle of your organization’s applications. Performing continuous security validation by incorporating these practices and standards into your CI CD pipeline, allow you to ensure that your applications remain secure.</p>

<h1 id="Project-Metrics-and-KPIs"><a href="#Project-Metrics-and-KPIs" class="headerlink" title="Project Metrics and KPIs"></a>Project Metrics and KPIs</h1><p>Hello and welcome to project metrics and KPIs. When putting together a project, the goals need to be specific and measurable, and they need to be defined at the outset of the project. Establishing measurable goals means that appropriate metrics and key performance indicators, or KPIs, need to be established and agreed upon.</p>
<p>Over the next several minutes we are going to take a look at some of the more commonly used metrics and KPIs as they relate to DevOps projects. We will review metrics and KPIs that provide faster outcomes, improve efficiency, ensure quality and security, and ensure a positive culture.</p>
<p>Some metrics and KPIs that can help produce faster outcomes for many DevOps projects include deployment frequency, deployment speed, and deployment size. Deployment frequency is important because the frequency of deployments is usually a critical driver in most DevOps projects. Deployment speed is also just as important, because DevOps projects benefit when you decrease the time it takes for deployments. Deployment size refers to the number of features, stories, and bug fixes that are deployed each time. This is also a key metric to track. </p>
<p>Efficiency can be improved by increasing the server to admin ratio, which refers to the number of administrators that are required for the number of servers that are necessary. Likewise, the staff member to customers ratio should also be kept at a minimum. This metric refers to the number of staff members that are necessary to serve a specific number of customers. Application usage and performance are two other key metrics to consider when trying to improve efficiency. While application usage refers to how busy an application is, application performance refers to how well the application is running, based on application metrics.</p>
<p>There are many different metrics and KPIs that should be tracked to ensure quality and security. For example, you should keep track of how often your deployments or applications fail. This metric is referred to as deployment failure rate. Application failure rates should also be tracked so that you know how often your application is experiencing configuration failures and performance timeouts. And while we are talking about failure rates, let’s not forget about mean time to recover. You should be paying attention to mean time to recover. Because this metric indicates how quickly you are able to recover from your failures.</p>
<p>Because it’s never a good thing when your customers double as bug testers, you need to be keeping track of bug report rates as well. You should always know how many bugs your customers are finding and whether they are increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p>Last but not least, availability metrics and SLA metrics are critical as well. By tracking availability, you can see what percentage of time your application is actually available for your customers. By tracking availability, you can measure against your service level agreements.</p>
<p>To ensure a positive culture in your organization, you need to keep employee morale and retention rates in mind. While employee morale can be difficult to measure, it’s important to understand if your employees are happy with where the organization is and where it’s heading, this is because it directly affects retention rates which of course you should also be monitoring. If your organization is losing staff, you need to find out why.</p>
<p>While these metrics that we just reviewed are the most common, what you really should be doing is tracking metrics that focus on the outcomes that you are trying to achieve. These metrics and KPIs will vary from project to project, and from organization to organization.</p>

<h1 id="Mentoring-Team-Members-on-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Mentoring-Team-Members-on-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Mentoring Team Members on Agile Practices"></a>Mentoring Team Members on Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to mentoring team members on agile practices. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what it takes to mentor team members so that agile practices can be implemented successfully.</p>
<p>When an organization decides to begin the transformation to Agile, it will usually bring in one or more agile coaches or mentors. These mentors are brought in to help the organization’s teams either adopt agile methods or to improve current methods that are in place. For these coaches and mentors to be effective, they must be real agents of change. By this, I mean that they must really want to help people realize how they are currently working and spending their time. And they must be good at driving adoption of the newer agile methods that they were brought in to develop.</p>
<p>When an agile coach or mentor is brought in, what the coach will typically do is work with multiple teams to implement the new agile methods. A key role of an agile coach or mentor is to remove both internal and external roadblocks that prevent the organization from implementing agile practices. To be effective at this, the agile coach or mentor needs to be good at not just coaching and mentoring, but also at teaching and facilitating. This is because the mentor needs to serve as both a consultant and a trainer.</p>
<p>Putting agile concepts into practice requires buy-in because doing so isn’t as simple as learning the concepts through an agile training course. It takes dedication to facilitate change.</p>
<p>Agile coaches and mentors come in many different flavors. For example, some mentors may be technical experts that prefer to teach an organization’s team members how to apply specific agile concepts and practices. Such technical oriented coaches and mentors may hold peer sessions with team members.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may have agile coaches and mentors that focus more on agile processes or on the management of work activities. These types of will often demonstrate how to run standup meetings and review meetings.</p>
<p>Although bringing in external agile coaches and mentors can kickstart the process for moving to agile practices, ultimately, the team members within the organization will need to develop the ability to mentor each other. As team members become skilled at mentoring each other and at learning from one another, the move to agile practices becomes easier. For this to happen, however, teams need to work in a collaborative fashion, the work cannot be done by individuals in a vacuum.</p>

<h1 id="In-Team-and-Cross-Team-Collaboration"><a href="#In-Team-and-Cross-Team-Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration"></a>In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration</h1><p>Hello and welcome to In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration. In this lesson, we will take a look at the ways that collaboration can be enabled in an organization.</p>
<p>To function well, Agile teams must be able to support effective collaboration. Effective collaboration will often require changes to an organization’s culture and to the ways that cross-functional teams collaborate. New collaboration tools may also need to be implemented.</p>
<p>In an effort to facilitate collaboration, many organizations, over recent years, have moved to open floor plans with very few walls. Although the intention is noble, open floor plans can, however, actually inhibit collaboration. Additionally, distractions can also often reduce productivity. It turns out that most people get more done when they are working in a quiet private environment.</p>
<p>While asynchronous communications should be encouraged, it should be understood that not all such communications are going to be treated with urgency. An organization’s employees should be able to focus on their jobs without feeling like decisions are being made without their input. Meetings that get scheduled should be scheduled with strictly enforced time frames and should follow clearly defined agendas. This means that if there is no specific agenda to discuss, there is no meeting.</p>
<p>Because of the shift to remote working and work from home, it’s also important that collaboration via communication become an accepted practice. As a matter of fact, the ability to collaborate with remote teammates should be an expected skillset. And whether or not communication is handled in person or remotely, all staff should feel comfortable communicating openly and frankly. Because there will always be disagreements and conflict within any team. It’s also important that team members enroll in some sort of mediation skills training.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the members of a specific team need to be able to collaborate effectively. However, it’s also just as critical that team members be able to collaborate with people outside of the immediate team. This is necessary because there will often be a need for people with different expertise to work together to achieve a specific goal. These people will often be from different departments or different teams within the organization.</p>
<p>Effective collaboration of cross-functional teams often results in innovation and improved results because it allows people with different areas of expertise to bring different perspectives to the same problem. This often results in alternate solutions that may not have otherwise been thought of.</p>
<p>Organizations with cross-functional teams that can collaborate well will often see fewer turf wars develop, because each team views itself as part of the solution. By recognizing and rewarding this type of team mentality, organizations can cement this feeling of team cohesion across many different cross-functional teams.</p>
<p>An important part of effective collaboration, whether it’s in-team or cross-team collaboration is tooling. To facilitate collaboration, organizations should consider tools and solutions that enable streamlined communications. Some tools that can help foster collaboration include Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams is the flagship chat and communications application from Microsoft. It offers various communication options, including chat, notes, and even meetings. It also facilitates the sharing of documents. I should also mention that Microsoft Teams makes it easy for internal communications as well as communications with external users.</p>
<p>Slack is another common collaboration tool that Agile teams often use. It offers multiple communication channels that can be organized by team, topic, or even project. The conversations that take place on Slack can be retained and can be searched. Like Microsoft Teams, Slack allows users to communicate with both internal and external teammates.</p>
<p>Google Hangouts is a tool that organizations use to facilitate collaboration and communication. It offers messaging, video, and chat. It also supports voice over IP features. Like the two other previous solutions mentioned, Google hangouts facilitates conversations among multiple users and can save chat histories online.</p>
<p>While these aren’t the only tools that can be used to facilitate in-team and cross-team collaboration, they are some of the more common ones. The most important thing to remember, however, is that to facilitate in-team and cross-team collaboration, you should implement tools that make it easier and not harder for your team members to communicate.</p>

<h1 id="Tools-and-Processes-for-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Tools-and-Processes-for-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Tools and Processes for Agile Practices"></a>Tools and Processes for Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to tools and processes for agile practices. In this lesson, we are going to touch on some of the physical tools, project management tools, and screen recording tools that you can use to facilitate agile practices in your organization.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly true that specific tools are not necessarily needed to develop using agile methods, using agile friendly tools can certainly improve your outcomes. That said, the process that you follow is really the most important tool for agile development. All of the tools that we are about to discuss are really secondary to the process itself.</p>
<p>While there are many digital tools available to facilitate your agile practices, physical tools also play a role. For example, many organizations rely on simple things, like whiteboards, when collaborating. Even sticky notes and index cards can be useful for making notes and for moving tasks around. I know it sounds old-school, but physical tools can often be more convenient and more effective under certain circumstances. So, don’t discount them.</p>
<p>Project management tools, by definition, are used to assist with project planning and execution along with monitoring. They are also helpful for managing and tracking releases. Project management tools are also used to record the outcomes of retrospectives and to work with them as well. Things like Kanban boards are often included in many different project management tools that are available.</p>
<p>Many tools will also offer visualizations and pretty graphics that measure team progress against the defined goals and targets that have been set. Other project management tools will even integrate with code repositories and CI&#x2F;CD tools.</p>
<p>Azure DevOps offers flexible Kanban boards and traceability via backlogs. It also offers customizable dashboards, scrum boards, and can even integrate with code repositories. This allows you to link code changes directly to tasks and bugs.</p>
<p>While Azure DevOps is a pretty robust project management tool for agile practices, there are some other common tools available. These tools include things like JIRA Agile, Tremolo, SprintGround, and many, many others. Your job is to determine which project management tools work best for your agile practice.</p>
<p>The last type of tools that I want to talk about here are screen recording tools. Screen recording tools are often overlooked when it comes to agile practices. However, they can actually be quite helpful, especially when there are remote team members involved. More specifically, screen recording tools like Camtasia and SnagIt, can be helpful because you can use them to record bugs in action. This allows team members to actually see what is happening. Such tools can also be used to record tutorials and demonstrations as well. That being the case, don’t discount screen recording tools when building an agile practice.</p>

<h1 id="Creating-Organizational-Structures-for-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Creating-Organizational-Structures-for-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices"></a>Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices. Anytime an organization reorganizes, things can get a little bit challenging, reorganizing to become agile is no exception. As I mentioned earlier in the course, becoming an agile organization requires a shift in culture. This means that any existing processes and even policies within the organization are going to be challenged. These reorganization pains are typically more noticeable in larger organizations, because there are often certain operating structures that are in place, as well as many rigid rules and methodologies.</p>
<p>Because businesses today are starting to recognize that their structures and processes do not lend themselves well to agile, many are now making changes. Such changes include the move from horizontal teams to vertical teams.</p>
<p>An organization that leverages a horizontal team structure will often divide its teams based on software architecture. For example, the image on your screen shows how an organization might be divided into teams that are based on user interface, service-oriented architecture and data.</p>
<p>However, a vertical team structure like the one you now see on your screen will typically align with outcomes and span across the architecture rather than mirror it.</p>
<p>Organizations will often leverage vertical teams when running agile projects because vertical teams will often result in stronger outcomes. Vertical teams also offer the flexibility of better scaling. This is because teams can be based on features rather than projects.</p>
<p>As you can see on the screen, we’ve built upon our previous vertical team structure simply by adding teams that reflect additional features and outcomes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when creating organizational structures for agile practices, you should aim to build vertical teams rather than horizontal ones.</p>

<h1 id="Course-Conclusion"><a href="#Course-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Course Conclusion"></a>Course Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations, you’ve come to the end of Designing and Implementing an Agile Work Management Approach. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We started things off by looking at project metrics and key performance indicators, or KPIs. You learned about some of the more commonly used metrics and KPIs as they relate to DevOps projects. We reviewed metrics and KPIs that produce faster outcomes, improve efficiency, ensure quality and security, and ensure a positive workforce culture.</p>
<p>We then took a look at what goes into properly mentoring team members on Agile practices, where you learned what skills are necessary to coach and mentor on Agile practices.</p>
<p>Later on, we dove into in-team and cross-team collaboration. You learned how to achieve effective collaboration through cultural changes, cross-functional team collaboration, and tooling. </p>
<p>After learning about collaboration, you learned about tools and processes that are necessary for Agile practices. We looked at physical tools, project management tools, and even touched on-screen recording tools.</p>
<p>We wrapped up by covering the steps and requirements for creating organizational structures for Agile practices. More specifically, we compared horizontal teams versus vertical teams.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have the foundational knowledge that is required to effectively design and implement an Agile work management approach.</p>
<p>To learn more about designing and implementing an Agile work management approach, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy because we’re always publishing new ones. Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As always, thanks for watching and happy learning.</p>

<h1 id="Additional-Topics"><a href="#Additional-Topics" class="headerlink" title="Additional Topics"></a>Additional Topics</h1><p>Congratulations on making it all the way through this learning path. If you’re preparing to write the Microsoft AZ-900 exam, bear in mind that although we’ve covered all of the major topics in the exam guide, there are a few details that weren’t covered. I’ll go over them briefly here.</p>
<p>Microsoft has dozens of Azure regions around the world, and these regions are grouped into geographies. Each geography meets data residency and compliance requirements. For example, the United Kingdom geography has data centers in the UK, so data stored in that geography will comply with UK data residency requirements.</p>
<p>The UK geography contains two regions: UK South and UK West. These two regions are paired regions. That means that if there’s an Azure outage that affects multiple regions, then at least one region in each regional pair will be prioritized for recovery. So if you have redundant resources in both regions in a regional pair, then you’ll have a good chance that at least one of those regions will be recovered quickly in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>A resource group is used to organize a set of related resources, such as virtual machines and database instances, that are part of a particular application. This seems pretty straightforward, but there are lots of little details about resource groups that you should know.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t put a resource in more than one resource group.</li>
<li>You can move a resource from one resource group to another. You can even move a resource from one subscription to another.</li>
<li>Resources don’t need to be in the same region as the resource group they’re in.</li>
<li>Tags are simply labels that you can apply to resources for management purposes. One common use is to apply organizational tags, such as Engineering and Marketing, to resources. That way, you can easily figure out how much to charge each department for their resource usage. You can apply tags to a resource group, but bear in mind that those tags do not get inherited by the resources in that resource group. So if you want to apply a tag to all of the resources in a resource group, you’ll have to apply it to them individually.</li>
<li>When you delete a resource group, all of the resources in it get deleted, too. This is a very useful way of making sure you delete all of the resources related to a particular application or project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure Storage has three tiers: hot, cool, and archive. Data in the hot and cool tiers can be accessed immediately because it’s stored online. It takes much longer to access data in the archive tier because it’s stored offline. Before it can be accessed, archive data must be “rehydrated”, a process that can take several hours. This rehydration process is why it costs more to retrieve data in archive storage than in hot or cool storage. Ideally, archive storage should be used for files that rarely need to be retrieved, such as long-term backups and compliance data.</p>
<p>Azure provides three types of platform logs that can help with troubleshooting and auditing. Resource logs (formerly known as diagnostic logs) contain information about things that happened within an Azure resource, such as accessing a database. Activity logs contain information at the subscription level about activities that were performed on a resource from the outside, such as shutting down a database instance. Azure Active Directory logs contain information about activities specifically related to Azure Active Directory, such as recent logins and new users added.</p>
<p>When a user accidentally modifies or deletes a resource, such as a virtual machine, it can have catastrophic consequences, so Microsoft provides a handy way to prevent this from happening. An administrator can apply a resource lock to important resources.</p>
<p>There are two types of locks: Delete and Read-only. A Delete lock, of course, prevents a resource from being deleted. A read-only lock prevents a resource from being deleted or modified, so it’s more restrictive than a Delete lock. If two different administrators add locks to the same resource, then the most restrictive lock is applied. Even an administrator can’t delete a locked resource, so they have to delete the lock (or locks) before they can delete the resource.</p>
<p>If you want to apply a lock to all of the resources in a resource group, you only have to apply the lock to the resource group itself, and all of the resources in it will inherit the lock. You can even do this at the subscription level for all resources in a subscription.</p>
<p>To enforce a wide variety of governance policies, you can use the Azure Policy service. For example, suppose your company has a European division that is legally required to store its data only in European data centers. You could create a policy that only allows SQL Database instances to be created in European regions and assign that policy to the resource group for that division of the company. You’d also need to create similar policies for other data storage services, such as SQL Data Warehouse and Data Lake Storage.</p>
<p>Now suppose you need to assign the same policies to a number of different resource groups or subscriptions. To make it easier, you can group related policies into what’s called an initiative and then assign that initiative to various subscriptions, resource groups, and management groups.</p>
<p>Speaking of management groups, what are they? If your organization has a lot of subscriptions, you’ll likely want to apply the same policies or policy initiatives to many of them. This would normally require applying them to each subscription individually, but there’s an easier way. You can put your subscriptions in management groups. Then when you apply a policy or a role assignment to a management group, it will be inherited by all of the subscriptions in that management group.</p>
<p>Since security, privacy, compliance, and trust are responsibilities that your organization shares with its service providers, Microsoft provides lots of resources to help you understand how they take care of their side of the arrangement.</p>
<p>The Trust Center contains a collection of links to resources about how Microsoft handles security, privacy, compliance, and transparency.</p>
<p>The Service Trust Portal is focused specifically on compliance. For example, it has links to Azure audit reports for regulatory standards like SOC, FedRAMP, and ISO27001. These will be helpful if your organization is going through these compliance audits. There’s also a link to a site called “Compliance Manager”.</p>
<p>This is a great tool that helps you achieve compliance. It creates assessments for different Microsoft services. It shows how compliant your organization is and how compliant Microsoft is for a particular area. For example, here’s a GDPR assessment for Office 365. You’ll notice that Microsoft Managed Actions is at 100%, which is always the case. In this example, Customer Managed Actions is at 0%. To find out how to move your organization into compliance, you can click on the assessment, and it will bring up a list of steps to complete. In most cases, you’ll need to upload evidence of your compliance. The main value of the Compliance Manager is that it helps you organize and track your compliance efforts.</p>
<p>If you’re involved in cloud solutions for the US government, then be aware that Microsoft provides Azure Government services that are in physically isolated data centers and networks. Azure Government is available to US government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as to their partners. To use these services, your organization has to meet eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>Microsoft also provides a physically separated Azure instance in China. It’s operated by 21Vianet.</p>
<p>That’s it for additional topics for the AZ-900 exam. If you have any questions or comments, please let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck on the exam!</p>

<h1 id="Managing-Azure-Costs-Introduction"><a href="#Managing-Azure-Costs-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Managing Azure Costs - Introduction"></a>Managing Azure Costs - Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Managing Azure Costs”. I’m Guy Hummel, and I’m a certified Azure Solutions Architect.</p>
<p>In this course, I’ll start by showing you how to use the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator. Then I’ll explain Azure subscription and purchasing options. Next, I’ll show you the Pricing Calculator. Then I’ll cover some of the most important ways to reduce costs. Finally, I’ll give you an overview of Azure Cost Management.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should already have some basic knowledge of Azure. If you don’t have any experience with Azure, then you can take our “Overview of Azure Services” course. </p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. Thanks!</p>
<h1 id="Total-Cost-of-Ownership-Calculator"><a href="#Total-Cost-of-Ownership-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Total Cost of Ownership Calculator"></a>Total Cost of Ownership Calculator</h1><p>If your organization is thinking about moving some or all of its IT workloads from an on-premises data center to Azure, one of the first things you’ll want to do is compare the cost of the two environments. This can be a daunting task because not only do you have to figure out how much everything will cost on Azure, but you also have to make sure you include all of your current costs for your on-premises infrastructure. This includes obvious costs like hardware and software but also many other costs, such as electricity, real estate, and labor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Microsoft provides a useful tool called the Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, Calculator. It uses industry averages for on-premises costs, and of course, the equivalent costs on Azure. There are three steps to using it. First, define your workloads. These fall into four categories: servers, databases, storage, and networking.</p>
<p>Second, adjust the assumptions used by the TCO Calculator. For example, the cost of electricity used by the calculator may be different from what you typically pay, so you can adjust that number. </p>
<p>Third, view the report. You can choose any time period between one and five years to compare the costs.</p>
<p>Let’s go through a simple example. Suppose we want to move these workloads to Azure: 20 Windows-based web servers running on Hyper-V, two physical SQL Servers, and one terabyte of storage. The TCO Calculator is at this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/">URL</a>. You don’t need to have an Azure subscription to access it, of course, because the whole idea is to use it before you migrate your workloads to Azure.</p>
<p>Okay, first we need to define our workloads, starting with servers. Let’s give this workload a name. We’ll call it “Web servers”. The information we need to fill in is what we’re currently using on-premises. Since we’re currently running on Windows servers in this example, we’ll leave the workload type as “Windows&#x2F;Linux Server”. Since I said that the 20 webservers are running on Hyper-V, we’ll need to change this to virtual machines. The operating system is Windows. And let’s say we have a Windows Datacenter license.</p>
<p>This is where we say that we have 20 virtual machines. And it’s already set to Hyper-V for the virtualization. This is the number of core or virtual CPUs per virtual machine. Let’s say we currently have 8 cores per VM. And let’s say we have 16 gigs of RAM per VM.</p>
<p>This “Optimize by” option will take a bit of explaining. When the calculator comes up with recommendations for Azure Virtual Machines, it tries to find a VM size that’s an exact match for the number of cores and gigs of RAM we specified. If it finds an exact match, then it ignores the “Optimize by” setting. If it can’t find an exact match, then it will look for a VM size that’s close, but it will make sure it has enough cores if we tell it to optimize by CPU, or it will make sure it has enough RAM if we tell it to optimize by memory. We’ll leave it set to “CPU”.</p>
<p>You only need to enable this option if you’re running Windows Server 2008, so we’ll leave it disabled. </p>
<p>If we wanted to define more workloads, we could click here and add another one, but we only have one workload in this example, so we’ll move to the next section.</p>
<p>I said we have two SQL Servers, so we’ll click “Add database”. Let’s call it “SQL Servers”. All of these options match our example, so we’ll leave them with the defaults. We need to change the servers to 2, though. And let’s put 2 processors per server, 4 cores per processor, and 8 gigs of RAM per server.</p>
<p>Down here, we need to tell it which Azure service we want to use because there are a few options. The one that’s the most compatible with SQL Server is “SQL Database Managed Instance”, so we’ll set it to that. I’ll leave these options as is, but let’s say we need 1,000 gigs of backup storage.</p>
<p>Now we’ll fill in the storage section. The capacity is already set to one terabyte, so we don’t need to change that, but let’s say we also have five terabytes of backup and ten terabytes of archive storage.</p>
<p>In the Networking section, let’s set the outbound bandwidth to 10 terabytes. This is the amount of outbound data these workloads normally transfer per month in our on-premises environment.</p>
<p>All right, we’re finally finished, so we’ll click “Next”. </p>
<p>Now we can adjust the assumptions. We can change the currency if we need to. And this is where we can say we have Microsoft Software Assurance coverage for our Windows and SQL Server licenses. This will reduce our costs because the licenses can be transferred to Azure.</p>
<p>There are lots of other assumptions we can change. For example, we can change our electricity costs here, and we can set our IT labor costs here. When we’re done changing assumptions, we click “Next”.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can see how much money we could potentially save by moving our workloads to Azure. That’s a pretty big number. To see the details, scroll down. Here’s the breakdown of the on-premises costs and the Azure costs. If the on-premises costs don’t look right, we can go back and change the assumptions. We can also go back to the top and change the timeframe from 5 years to something shorter like 2 years. As you’d expect, that changes the cost savings.</p>
<p>And that’s it for the TCO Calculator.</p>
<h1 id="Subscriptions-and-Purchasing-Options"><a href="#Subscriptions-and-Purchasing-Options" class="headerlink" title="Subscriptions and Purchasing Options"></a>Subscriptions and Purchasing Options</h1><p>Before you can use Azure, you need to have a subscription. It’s used by Microsoft for billing purposes. Whenever you create a resource in Azure, it will be assigned to a subscription, so Microsoft will know how to bill for that resource. It’s possible to have multiple subscriptions, but each Azure resource can only be assigned to one subscription.</p>
<p>There’s actually one other element that’s needed before Microsoft can charge you, and that’s a billing account. It contains the payment details, such as your credit card information. Every subscription needs to be linked to one (and only one) billing account, so Microsoft will know how you’ll be paying for the subscription. But it is possible to link multiple subscriptions to one billing account. That’s because you could use the same payment method for multiple subscriptions. Why would you want to do that? Well, you could use subscriptions to organize your resources. For example, you could have a separate subscription for each department in your organization so you could track each department’s costs.</p>
<p>The person who creates an Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for it and has full access to every aspect of that subscription.</p>
<p>There are three main types of subscriptions available: free, pay-as-you-go, and member offers. The free trial subscription lets you use a limited amount of certain Azure services for free every month. It also gives you a $200 credit that you can use on most of the Azure services that aren’t on the list of free services or for more than the monthly allotment of the free services. You can only use this $200 credit for up to 30 days. After that, you need to upgrade to a pay-as-you-go subscription to keep using the free services. Twelve months after the start of the trial, you’ll no longer get the monthly allotment of free services.</p>
<p>When you create a free trial subscription, it also creates a billing account, so you have to enter credit card or debit card information, even though Microsoft won’t charge you until you upgrade the subscription to pay-as-you-go. Microsoft only allows one free trial per customer.</p>
<p>The pay-as-you-go subscription, as you can tell from the name, lets you pay for the Azure resources as you use them. That is, you don’t have to sign a long-term contract. You pay for what you use on a monthly basis, and you can cancel at any time. This is also known as consumption-based billing.</p>
<p>Microsoft has many types of member offers that give you reduced rates for Azure services if you’re a member of certain groups, such as MSDN Platform subscribers or Visual Studio subscribers. These types of subscriptions offer substantial discounts over a pay-as-you-go subscription, so it’s highly recommended that you take advantage of any offers you qualify for. You can find current offers at this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/offer-details/">URL</a>.</p>
<p>There are three options for purchasing Azure subscriptions. The most straightforward one is called Web Direct. This is when you purchase directly through the Azure website.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your organization plans to purchase a large amount of Microsoft products and services, then you can save money by signing an Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft. This is a negotiated agreement that comes with substantial discounts. In exchange for these discounts, you need to sign a long-term commitment, for a minimum of three years, to use a certain amount of Microsoft products and services. Enterprise agreements are typically billed on an annual basis.</p>
<p>If you need to run a custom third-party solution on Azure, then one option is to purchase through a Cloud Solution Provider, or CSP. This is a Microsoft partner that develops Azure-based solutions. A CSP will bill you for both Azure and its own solutions. It also provides you with technical support.</p>
<p>If you need to buy an off-the-shelf third-party solution that runs on Azure, then once you have an Azure subscription, you can go to the Azure Marketplace and purchase one. Many vendors, such as Oracle and Red Hat, offer virtual machine images that you can spin up immediately after buying them in the Marketplace.</p>
<p>And that’s it for subscriptions and purchasing options.</p>
<h1 id="Pricing-Calculator"><a href="#Pricing-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Pricing Calculator"></a>Pricing Calculator</h1><p>The Total Cost of Ownership Calculator is good for helping you determine how much money you’ll save by migrating to Azure, but it’s not a general-purpose tool for figuring out how much any given Azure service will cost. For that, you need to use the Pricing Calculator.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to launch a website, and you’d like to get an estimate of how much it would cost to run it on Azure App Service. You’d go to the Pricing Calculator, and select “App Service”. Alternatively, you can start typing the product’s name here, which is often faster than trying to find it.</p>
<p>The options you need to choose depend on the specific service you’ve selected. For App Service, you need the region, the operating system, and the tier. The region is important because pricing is often different for different regions. The price is also different depending on which operating system you choose.</p>
<p>If you don’t know which tier you need, this information bubble will help, although it doesn’t give you all of the details for each tier. To get more information, you’d have to look in the documentation. But this is good enough for our purposes. We can set it to the Basic tier.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the tier, you have more options to set. First, there’s the instance type. We can leave it with the default. Then you need to specify the number of instances and the number of hours. It seems kind of odd that the default here is 730 hours, doesn’t it? Well, that’s the average number of hours in a month. If you want, you can just change it to 1 month, which will give you the same price.</p>
<p>You can also set the number of SSL connections, which is another option that’s specific to App Service. SNI SSL connections are free, so if we set this to ‘1’, it doesn’t change the price.</p>
<p>Here’s the estimated monthly cost. Bear in mind that this is only an estimate, so the actual cost could be different. It’s usually close, though.</p>
<p>There are still a couple of other options that can change the price. First, you can choose a different support plan. Then there’s the licensing program.</p>
<p>If you want to get price estimates for other Azure services as well, then you can add them in the same way we added App Service, and the total monthly cost will include the cost of all of the services you’ve selected.</p>
<p>When you’re done, you can export it, save it, or share it. And that’s it for the Pricing Calculator.</p>
<h1 id="Reducing-Costs"><a href="#Reducing-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Reducing Costs"></a>Reducing Costs</h1><p>Although you can get cost estimates using the Pricing Calculator, it helps if you understand some of the biggest factors that affect Azure costs. One of the most important is the region where Microsoft hosts your Azure resources. Many customers prefer to use resources in a region that is closest to them. For example, a customer in South America might choose to put its resources in one of Microsoft’s regions in Brazil. However, for many Azure services, the cost is significantly higher in the Brazilian regions than in the US regions. For some services, it can even be twice as expensive. So if network latency or data residency requirements aren’t important for your application, you might want to consider using one of the cheaper regions.</p>
<p>Another important factor is where you transfer your data from and to. When you transfer data to an Azure resource, it’s known as ingress traffic, and the cost is free. When you transfer data from an Azure resource, it’s known as egress traffic, and there’s often a cost. If you transfer within the same region, it’s free, but if you transfer to another region or to a location outside of the Azure network, then there’s a cost. So it’s usually best to put your resources together in the same region unless you have a good reason to split them across multiple regions.</p>
<p>One common question is how resource groups are affected by regions. For example, if you have a resource group in the West US region, and it contains resources in the Canada Central region, will that cause any problems, and will it incur any charges? Fortunately, it won’t cause any problems, and it won’t incur any additional charges. The location of the resource group is irrelevant, and resource groups themselves do not cost anything. The resources contained in them incur charges.</p>
<p>Aside from choosing your regions carefully, there are many other ways to reduce your costs. One way is to purchase reserved capacity. Normally, Microsoft uses metering to charge you for your Azure resources. That is, it tracks your usage and charges you based on what you’ve used. But if you know that you’re going to be using an Azure resource for more than a year, then you can save money by committing to a long-term contract.</p>
<p>Only some Azure services can be purchased this way, and the amount you save varies, but if you commit to a one-year or three-year term for a virtual machine instance, for example, you can save up to 72 percent.</p>
<p>When you make a reservation, you need to choose which region the VM will reside in. If you need to move it to another region, you have to make a new reservation and exchange the old one for the new one.</p>
<p>Whether you buy reserved instances or regular pay-as-you-go instances, you can also save money by using the Azure Hybrid Benefit. If you have existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses, and they’re covered by a Microsoft Software Assurance plan, you can move those licenses to Azure. Then you can use those licenses to reduce your costs on Azure VMs, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce costs is to use Azure Spot Virtual Machines. These VMs can be up to 90% cheaper, but there’s a catch. A spot VM can be removed with only 30 seconds’ notice. So you can’t use them for mission-critical applications. They should only be used for tasks that can be restarted, such as batch processing, development and testing, or video rendering.</p>
<p>That isn’t the only way you can save money on VMs, though. You can also resize underutilized virtual machines to a cheaper option. For example, if one of your VMs typically uses only 10% of its CPU capacity, then you could switch it to a VM size that has less CPU capacity, which would be less expensive.</p>
<p>You don’t even have to go searching for these overpowered VMs yourself because you can just go to the Cost tab in Azure Advisor, and it’ll tell you about sources of potential cost savings, including any underutilized VMs you’re running. It’ll also tell you if any of these underutilized VMs could possibly be shut down entirely.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that if a VM is stopped (which is also known as deallocated), it could still incur charges. You won’t have to pay for the compute resources since it won’t be running, but you will have to pay for any data disks and static public IP addresses that are attached to the VM.</p>
<p>Even deleting the VM won’t necessarily delete all of the associated resources that you have to pay for. By default, data disks and public IP addresses persist after a VM has been deleted, so you’ll need to delete them separately. Once again, Azure Advisor can help because it’ll tell you if you have any unused public IP addresses. </p>
<p>And that’s it for reducing costs.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Cost-Management"><a href="#Azure-Cost-Management" class="headerlink" title="Azure Cost Management"></a>Azure Cost Management</h1><p>When you want to get serious about controlling your costs, the place to go is Azure Cost Management. It provides four key features: cost analysis, budgets, alerts, and recommendations. The recommendations module is actually provided by Azure Advisor, which we covered in the previous lesson, so I won’t go over it again here.</p>
<p>The cost analysis module lets you drill down into your costs to find out where your organization is spending the most on Azure. You can break down your costs by service, region, and subscription, and you can see how these costs have changed on a daily or monthly basis. The data is displayed in charts and tables, which makes it much easier to analyze. It also shows you a forecast of how much you will spend if you continue using Azure resources at the same pace for the rest of the month.</p>
<p>As nice as the cost analysis module is, most people wouldn’t want to go into it every day to keep costs under control. A better approach is to create a budget and some alerts. Setting up a budget is very simple. You just need to say how much you expect to spend on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Then you can set alerts to warn you when your costs are approaching the budgeted amount. You can set multiple alerts at different levels. For example, you can set alerts to email you when your spending in the current month has reached 75%, 90%, and 100% of your budgeted amount. Alternatively, you can set alerts to tell you when the forecast for the current month reaches a particular percentage of your budget. That would give you more warning, but it could end up sending a lot of unnecessary alerts if you have frequent temporary spikes in usage.</p>
<p>The examples I’ve given so far have assumed that all of your organization’s costs would be lumped together, but for larger organizations, that’s not feasible. So Azure provides three levels of management that you can use to make it easier to track costs separately: management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. </p>
<p>Individual resources, such as VMs or SQL Database instances, that are related to each other in some way, are put into a resource group. For example, you might put all of the services used by a particular application in the same resource group. Related resource groups are part of a subscription. For example, you might have a separate subscription for each team in a department. Related subscriptions can be put into a management group. One common approach is to have a separate management group for each department.</p>
<p>Once you have this structure in place, you can use cost analysis, budgets, and alerts for any element in the hierarchy. For example, you could set separate budgets for a management group, a subscription, and even a specific resource group.</p>
<p>Before we go, I should also mention that there’s an additional mechanism you can use for tracking costs: tags. If you apply the same tag to a bunch of different Azure resources, then you can see the total cost of all of those resources in Azure Cost Management.</p>
<p>And that’s it for this lesson.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Azure-Costs-Summary"><a href="#Managing-Azure-Costs-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Managing Azure Costs - Summary"></a>Managing Azure Costs - Summary</h1><p>Let’s do a quick review of what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>The Total Cost of Ownership Calculator helps you compare how much your current workloads cost in your on-premises environment with how much they would cost in Azure. It takes into account a wide range of costs, such as real estate, electricity, and IT labor costs. You don’t need to have an Azure subscription to use the TCO Calculator.</p>
<p>A subscription is used by Microsoft for billing purposes. Each Azure resource is assigned to one subscription. A billing account contains the payment details, such as your credit card information. Every subscription needs to be linked to a billing account.</p>
<p>The person who creates an Azure subscription becomes the global administrator for it and has full access to every aspect of that subscription.</p>
<p>The three types of subscriptions are free, pay-as-you-go, and member offers. The free trial subscription lets you use a limited amount of certain Azure services. The pay-as-you-go subscription lets you pay for the Azure resources as you use them. Member offers give you reduced rates for Azure services if you’re a member of certain groups.</p>
<p>There are three options for purchasing Azure subscriptions. With Web Direct, you purchase directly through the Azure website. With an Enterprise Agreement, you sign a long-term commitment to use a certain amount of Microsoft products and services. The third option is to purchase Azure through a Cloud Solution Provider, which is a Microsoft partner that develops Azure-based solutions.</p>
<p>The Azure Marketplace lets you buy third-party virtual machine images that run on Azure.</p>
<p>The Pricing Calculator gives you cost estimates for Azure services. Each type of Azure service has different options that affect the price.</p>
<p>If network latency or data residency requirements aren’t important for your application, you could reduce costs by running it on Azure services in one of Microsoft’s less expensive regions.</p>
<p>When you transfer data to an Azure resource, it’s known as ingress traffic, and the cost is free. When you transfer data from an Azure resource, it’s known as egress traffic, and there’s often a cost. If you transfer within the same region, it’s free, but if you transfer to another region or to a location outside of the Azure network, then there’s a cost.</p>
<p>If you know that you’re going to be using an Azure resource for more than a year, then you can save money by purchasing a reserved instance.</p>
<p>With the Azure Hybrid Benefit, if you have existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses, and they’re covered by a Microsoft Software Assurance plan, you can move those licenses to Azure to save money.</p>
<p>Azure Spot VMs can be up to 90% cheaper than regular VMs, but spot VMs can be removed with only 30 seconds’ notice, so they should only be used for tasks that can be restarted.</p>
<p>Azure Advisor gives you recommendations on how to reduce costs, such as letting know if you have underutilized VMs that could be resized to a cheaper option or shut down entirely.</p>
<p>To stop a VM from incurring charges, you need to delete the VM itself plus any associated data disks and public IP addresses.</p>
<p>Azure Cost Management provides cost analysis, budgets, alerts, and recommendations. You can track costs separately at three different levels: management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. You can also track the total cost of all resources that have the same tag applied to them.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks!</p>
