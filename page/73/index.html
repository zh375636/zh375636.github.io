          <h1 id="Course-Introduction"><a href="#Course-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course Introduction"></a>Course Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to Overview of Azure Services. My name’s Guy Hummel and I’m a Microsoft-certified Azure Expert. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a message, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to Microsoft Azure. It’ll give you a broad overview of the types of services available in Azure without going too deeply into any of them.</p>
<p>This course is intended for anyone who’d like to learn more about Azure, so you don’t need to have any experience with it before taking this course. It would be helpful to have some general technical knowledge though because I don’t explain basic terms like <em>file server</em> or <em>operating system</em>.</p>
<p>The best way to learn is by doing, so I recommend that you try performing these tasks yourself on your own Azure account. If you don’t already have one, then you can create a free trial account.</p>
<p>To save you the trouble of typing in the URLs and commands shown in this course, I’ve put them in a readme file in a GitHub repository. You can find a link to the repository at the bottom of the Overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to describe some of the Azure services available in various categories, use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-portal/">Azure Portal</a>, and use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-cli/">Azure command line</a>. We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re ready to learn about what you can do with Microsoft Azure, then let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Overview"><a href="#Azure-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Azure Overview"></a>Azure Overview</h1><p>So what is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">Microsoft Azure</a>? To put it simply, it’s a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications. The best part is that you don’t need to have your own data center or even any servers because Azure runs in Microsoft’s data centers around the world, which your users can access over the internet.</p>
<p>Not only does this approach save you the trouble of having to build and maintain your own on-premises IT infrastructure, but it can also save you money because you only have to pay for what you use, and you can scale your Azure resources up and down as needed.</p>
<p>For most applications, you need three core elements: compute, storage, and networking. Let’s start with compute. In Azure’s early days, Microsoft offered only one type of compute service: virtual machines, or VMs for short. These are machines that run either Windows or Linux. If you currently have an application running on a Windows or Linux server, then the most straightforward way to migrate it to Azure is to do what’s called a “lift and shift” migration. That is, you simply lift the application from your on-premises server and shift it to a virtual server in the cloud. Azure VMs are known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service because they’re traditional IT infrastructure components that are offered as a service.</p>
<p>Later, Microsoft came out with what’s known as a Platform-as-a-Service offering called Azure App Service. This platform lets you host web and mobile applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. After doing a minor amount of configuration, you can just upload your code to an App Service instance and let Azure take care of the details. In most cases, this is a better solution than using virtual machines, but there are times when it makes more sense to use VMs. For example, if you have an application that’s not a web or mobile app, then you can’t use App Service, so you’ll have to use a VM.</p>
<p>These days, the hottest compute technology is containers. These are self-contained software environments. For example, a container might include a complete application plus all of the third-party packages it needs. Containers are somewhat like virtual machines except they don’t include the operating system. This makes it easy to deploy them because they’re very lightweight compared to virtual machines. In fact, containers run on virtual machines.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides a variety of ways to run containers. The simplest way is to use Azure Container Instances. This service lets you run a container using a single command. If you have a more complex application that involves multiple containers, then you’ll probably want to use Azure Kubernetes Service, which is what’s known as a container orchestrator. It makes it easy to deploy and manage multi-container applications.</p>
<p>Before we move on, I should mention one more compute service. It’s called Azure Functions, and it’s Microsoft’s main “serverless” offering. Azure Functions is kind of like Azure App Service except that it executes individual functions rather than entire applications, and you only pay for it when it gets used. When you provision an App Service instance, it runs until you shut it down, and you pay for it the whole time it’s running. Although it’s possible to configure Azure Functions in the same way, it’s usually better to use the Consumption plan, which means that it only uses resources when a function is running, so you only pay when a function is running.</p>
<p>Okay, that was a lot of compute options. Now let’s move on to storage. Believe it or not, there are even more options for storage than for compute. That’s because I’m also including databases and other data stores in the storage category.</p>
<p>The simplest form of storage is called Blob storage. It’s referred to as object storage, but really it’s just a collection of files. It’s not like a normal file system, though, because it doesn’t have a hierarchical folder structure. It has a flat structure. It’s typically used for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and log files.</p>
<p>One of the great things about it is that it has multiple access tiers: hot, cool, and archive. The hot tier is for frequently accessed files. The cool tier is for files you expect to access only about once a month or less. The advantage is that it costs less than the hot tier as long as you don’t access it frequently. The archive tier is for files that are rarely accessed, such as backup files. It has the lowest storage costs but the highest retrieval costs. It also takes several hours to retrieve files from the archive tier.</p>
<p>If you need hierarchical file storage, there are a couple of options. The one that will probably seem more familiar is Azure File Storage, which is like a typical SMB file server. It serves up file shares that you can mount on Windows servers. The less familiar option is Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. This is Hadoop-compatible storage for use with data analytics applications. </p>
<p>Okay, now how about relational databases? In an on-premises Microsoft environment, SQL Server is the most commonly used database. The cloud equivalent is Azure SQL Database. It’s very similar to SQL Server, although it’s not 100% compatible. If you need to run an open source database, then Microsoft still has you covered. It offers Azure Database for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>All of these databases, including both SQL Database and the open source options, are suitable for online transaction processing. On the other hand, if you need to build a data warehouse, then Azure Synapse Analytics is the best choice.</p>
<p>If you release an application that attracts a very large number of users, you may find that a traditional relational database can’t scale to meet the demand. One common solution is to use a so-called NoSQL database. These databases are designed to handle far more data than relational databases. However, in order to achieve that massive scalability, they have to sacrifice something, so they don’t support all of the features of relational databases. Nonetheless, they have become a cornerstone of many cloud-based applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s main NoSQL offering is called Cosmos DB. It’s an amazing database service that can scale globally. Another NoSQL service is Azure Cache for Redis, which is typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of storage options, and I still didn’t cover them all, but you don’t need to know every single option at this point, so let’s move on to network services.</p>
<p>When you create a virtual machine on Azure, you have to put it in a virtual network, or VNet. A virtual network is very similar to an on-premises network. Each virtual machine in a VNet gets an IP address, and it can communicate with other VMs in the same VNet. You can also divide a VNet into subnets and define routes to specify how traffic should flow between them. </p>
<p>By default, all outbound traffic from a VM to the internet is allowed. If you also want to allow inbound traffic, then you need to assign a public IP address to the VM.</p>
<p>If you want VMs in one VNet to be able to communicate with VMs in another VNet, then you can connect the VNets together using VNet peering. By the way, so far, I’ve only been talking about virtual machines, but other resources, such as Kubernetes clusters, can be in VNets, too.</p>
<p>If you want to create a secure connection between a VNet and an on-premises network, then you can use either a VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network, or Azure ExpressRoute. A VPN sends encrypted traffic over the public internet, whereas ExpressRoute communicates over a private, dedicated connection between your site and Microsoft’s Azure network. ExpressRoute is much more expensive than a VPN, but it provides higher speed and reliability since it’s a dedicated connection.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other network services available as well, but the ones I’ve covered are enough to give you a good high-level understanding of Azure networking.</p>
<p>Azure also provides a wide variety of other services outside of the core compute, storage, and networking categories, such as in hot areas like artificial intelligence and DevOps. I’ll go over some of those later.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand how Azure works is to actually use it, so in the next lesson, we’ll create a virtual machine. If you’re ready, then go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-portal/">next video</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-Azure-Portal"><a href="#Using-the-Azure-Portal" class="headerlink" title="Using the Azure Portal"></a>Using the Azure Portal</h1><p>Now we’re going to dive into using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">Azure</a>. Suppose you have a server application that you want to migrate to the cloud. As I mentioned earlier, the most straightforward way to do this is to move the application to a virtual machine on Azure.</p>
<p>There are many ways to interact with Azure, the Azure portal runs in a browser, so you don’t need to install anything to use it. Alternatively, you can install the CLI, which stands for command-line interface, or Azure PowerShell or the SDK, which stands for Software Development Kit.</p>
<p>If you want to use a command-based interface, and you have a lot of experience with PowerShell, then that’s probably your best bet. Otherwise, use the CLI, which is easier to learn than PowerShell. It’s actually possible to use the CLI and PowerShell from inside the browser too without having to install anything on your desktop. I’ll show you how to do that in the next lesson.</p>
<p>The SDK is what you need to use if you’re going to add code in your applications to interact with Azure.</p>
<p>It’s even possible to interact with Azure from a mobile device by using the Azure mobile app. You can even use the CLI and PowerShell from the mobile app.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started, though, is to use the Azure portal. So if you’re following along on your own account, go to portal.azure.com. There are a few different ways to get to the place where you can create a VM. In this search box, you can start typing virtual machine and you’ll see it come up at the top of the search results.</p>
<p>Another way is to go into the menu on the left and select virtual machines. It takes you to the same place. Once you’re here, you can click Add.</p>
<p>The first thing it wants to know is what subscription to put this VM in. It always sets this to your default subscription, so you can usually just leave it that way. But I should explain what a subscription is.</p>
<p>When you sign up for an Azure account, Microsoft creates both a billing account and a subscription. It’s easy to get the two mixed up because they’re both involved in billing. A <em>billing account</em> is an agreement you or your organization sign to use Microsoft services. A <em>subscription</em> is actually just a collection of Azure resources. But all of the resources in a subscription are on the same monthly bill, so it’s also a unit of billing.</p>
<p>So why do you need to have both a billing account and a subscription? Well, you might want to have multiple subscriptions in your billing account. Since each subscription generates a separate invoice, it can be useful to have a separate subscription for each department in your organization. Also, since the resources in different subscriptions are isolated from each other, you might want to have multiple subscriptions for security or compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Okay, so we’ll leave the subscription with the default. Next, it’s asking for the resource group. Like a subscription, a resource group is a collection of resources, but a subscription can have multiple resource groups so it’s a way of further grouping the resources within a subscription.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to divide resources into resource groups. But the best practice is to group related resources together, such as a VM and its associated storage account. Generally speaking, the resources in a group should be created and deleted at the same time, which makes sense if they’re components that work together to provide a solution.</p>
<p>All right, so let’s create a new resource group to hold this VM. I’ll call it example-RG. Now we need to give the VM a name. I’ll call it example-VM. Next we need to decide which region the VM should run in.</p>
<p>Microsoft has data centers on every continent except Antarctica. Each of these dots is a region, and each region contains multiple Azure data centers. You usually want to choose a region that’s closest to where your users are located. I’ll choose West US 2. Notice that it has a diamond in it. That’s because it has availability zones. I’ll explain what those are in a minute.</p>
<p>You need to set an availability option if you want to make sure your application will still be available, even if Azure experiences an outage that affects this VM. The first option is “Availability zone”, which is what I just showed you on the map. A region that supports availability zones has at least three data centers, each of which is called a zone. If you put VMs in multiple zones, then a data center outage won’t take down your application, because your VMs and other zones will still be running.</p>
<p>It added another field called “Availability zone”. We can choose 1, 2, or 3. It doesn’t really matter which one we choose for this VM, but if we were to create a second VM, we’d need to put it in a different availability zone. I’ll choose “1”. </p>
<p>Next, we need to choose a VM image. This is a copy of the disk that will be used for the VM. The choices are different versions of Linux and Windows, such as Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Windows Server. This is only a small subset of the images that are available. You can click on this link to see more. For example, suppose you want an image that includes not only Windows Server but also SQL Server, click on Databases and then type “sql server”. Surprisingly, there are images of SQL Server on Linux first. I’ll add windows to the search to narrow it down. There we go. There are lots of SQL Server image options. For this example, we’ll just go back and pick one of the basic options though. I’ll pick the Ubuntu server option.</p>
<p>If you use an Azure spot instance for this VM, then the cost will be dramatically lower, but the VM might be shut down with only 30 seconds’ notice. So you should only use this option for non-critical workloads.</p>
<p>There are lots of options for the size of the VM. At the top of the list, there’s a size with only one virtual CPU, half a gig of memory, and four gigs of temporary storage. You can see that the cost per month is very low. Some of these other options are much bigger, but so is the cost. Since we’re not actually going to use this VM, I’ll choose the cheapest option.</p>
<p>Here, we need to create the administrator account. In most cases, you should use an SSH public key for authenticating to the VM. But to keep it simple for this demo, I’ll use a password. You can name your administrator account almost anything.</p>
<p>The inbound port rules let you open up the VM to access from the internet. If this VM will be acting as a web server, then you’ll want to open up ports 80 and 443. There’s also an option to open up the SSH port so you can log into the VM remotely. The problem with opening up the SSH port here is that it will allow access from all internet addresses, which is dangerous. There are other more secure ways to give yourself access to the VM. So you shouldn’t select this unless you’re just doing some testing. I’m going to set this to “None”.</p>
<p>That’s it for the basic settings, but there are a few more settings we should have a look at. We’ll click this button to go to the disks tab. The operating system disk is set to premium SSD by default. That option has the highest performance, but it’s much more expensive than the other two. I’ll set it to Standard SSD. You can also add data disks if you want.</p>
<p>And now let’s have a look at the networking options. By default, it creates a virtual network, a subnet inside that virtual network, and a public IP address. If we already had another virtual network, we could put it in there instead if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Okay, that takes care of the compute, storage, and networking options for this VM. So let’s create it. First, click “Review + Create”. It says that our settings have passed validation testing. Then it summarizes all of our settings. Now click the Create button.</p>
<p>It’ll take a little while to create, so I’ll fast forward. All right, it’s done. We can click on “Go to resource” to have a look at the VM. </p>
<p>Here it shows the details of this VM, such as its status, and its public IP address. Up here it has some controls that let you stop and restart the VM or even delete it. If we had set up SSH authentication, then we could connect to it from here too. In the menu on the left, there are all kinds of options for things like activity logs, security, backups, and monitoring.</p>
<p>That’s it for this demo, you should have a pretty good idea of how to create resources in the portal now, because the process is fairly similar, regardless of what kind of Azure resources you’re creating. If you’re following along on your own Azure account, you might want to look around and see what you can do with your new VM.</p>
<p>When you’re done, make sure you delete the VM so you don’t incur any ongoing charges. The best way to delete everything associated with the VM, including the public IP address, etc., is to delete its resource group. Select Resource groups in this menu, and then click on “example-rg”. Here’s a list of all the resources associated with the VM. Now click “Delete resource group”. Then type the name of the resource group. Then click the Delete button.</p>
<p>Now if you’re ready to see how to work with Azure using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-cli/"><em>command-line interface</em></a>, then please go to the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Using-the-Azure-CLI"><a href="#Using-the-Azure-CLI" class="headerlink" title="Using the Azure CLI"></a>Using the Azure CLI</h1><p>As you saw in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-portal/">last demo</a>, it’s pretty easy to use the portal to create Azure resources but it’s definitely not the most efficient way to do it because it requires a lot of pointing and clicking. An alternative is to use the command line. Although it can be more difficult since you have to know the exact names of all the command line options. Once you’ve mastered it, you can often create and manage resources much more quickly.</p>
<p>In this demo, I’m going to show you how to create a website using Azure App Service. Do you remember when I said that it’s possible to use the command line without having to install anything on your desktop? Well, now that you’re familiar with the portal, I’ll show you how.</p>
<p>You see this icon to the right of the search bar? That’s how you start something called the Cloud Shell. It’s a very small virtual machine that you can use to run Azure commands. Click on it.</p>
<p>The first time you run Cloud Shell, it’ll ask you for permission to create a storage account that the Cloud Shell VM can use. This isn’t the first time I’ve used Cloud Shell, so my storage account is already set up. If you do get a dialogue box asking for permission, then click the option to create a storage account.</p>
<p>Cloud Shell supports both PowerShell and the Bash shell. You can switch between them using this menu. We’re going to use the Bash Shell because the commands are simpler. If you’re familiar with Linux commands, then it will be especially easy.</p>
<p>First, we need to download the files for a sample website. The command to do that is pretty long, so it’s easiest to copy and paste it. You can get it from the read me file in the GitHub repository for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">this course</a>. You can find a link to the repository at the bottom of the overview tab below this video.</p>
<p>Okay, copy this <code>git clone</code> command and paste it into the Cloud Shell window. It created a directory (which is the Linux term for folder) called html-docs-hello-world. Change into that directory with the <code>cd</code> command. I’m just going to use keyboard shortcuts to do the copying and pasting now. Now we can create an Azure App Service Web App using one command. Here it is.</p>
<p>It starts with <code>az</code> which means it’s an Azure command. Then we say <code>webapp</code> which is the command for Azure App Service. Then <code>up</code> which means to create the web app using the code in the current directory. Then we say <code>--location</code> and the name of the region where we want to deploy the web app. I’ve set it to <code>westus</code>. Then we say <code>--name</code> and what we want to call the app. I’m calling it <code>ca-example,</code> but you’ll have to call it something else because the name has to be unique among all of the out service names across all Azure customers. Then we say <code>--html</code> to tell it that we’re creating a static HTML website. Now hit Enter.</p>
<p>That’s all you have to do to create a website running on Azure App Service. It’ll take a little while to deploy so I’ll fast forward.</p>
<p>Okay, it’s done. Now we can make sure the website is working by going to this URL. Remember to change this name to the one you used. Great, there’s the sample website.</p>
<p>All right, now let’s delete the web app, so we don’t incur any more charges. In the VM demo, we deleted everything associated with the VM by deleting its resource group. We can do the same thing here but since we didn’t specify a resource group name in the command, how do we do that? App Service created a resource group for us. You’ll see it in the output from the command. Type <code>az group delete --name</code> then copy and paste the resource group name from here. Type “y”.</p>
<p>While that’s getting deleted, I should mention that there are many ways to deploy a web app. For example, both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code can publish an app directly to Azure App Service without you needing to use the Azure portal or the command line. Once the app is deployed, though, you’ll need to use the portal or the CLI to manage it.</p>
<p>And that’s it for using the CLI.</p>
<h1 id="Service-Categories"><a href="#Service-Categories" class="headerlink" title="Service Categories"></a>Service Categories</h1><p>So far, I’ve only talked about compute, storage, and networking services, but Microsoft offers services in many other categories as well. I won’t talk about all of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">Azure services</a> available, but I’ll go over some of the highlights.</p>
<p>If your organization is just getting started with Azure, then one of the first things you’ll want to do is figure out how you can migrate at least some of your existing applications to Azure. Microsoft provides a great tool for this called Azure Migrate.</p>
<p>First, it discovers your on-premises servers, both physical and virtual. On the virtual side, this includes both Hyper-V and VMware. Then it assesses these machines. For each one, it tells you whether or not it’s ready to migrate, how big the Azure VM will be, how much it will cost, and any dependent servers that will also need to be migrated. When you’re ready, it will even help you do the migration. Azure Migrate is also integrated with other tools to help you migrate SQL Server databases, web apps, and data. Also, if you have a virtual desktop infrastructure, there’s a tool that will do an assessment to help you migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop, which is hosted on Azure.</p>
<p>Another question that always comes up is, “How do we integrate our on-premises identities with Azure?” In most cases, organizations are using Active Directory for identity management. Naturally, Microsoft has a good solution for these customers. And, not surprisingly, it’s called Azure Active Directory. This is a managed identity service that takes care of authentication. It’s not exactly the same as Active Directory, but it’s very similar, and there are many options for synchronizing your on-premises directory with your Azure directory.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to the development area. The DevOps approach has spread rapidly in organizations around the world. If you’re not familiar with it, the idea is that you can automate large portions of the building, testing, and releasing of application updates. Microsoft offers a suite of services called Azure DevOps to help you implement these processes. The most important service in this suite is called Azure Pipelines. It lets you create automated workflows to continuously build, test, and deploy code.</p>
<p>Another service that helps with the development process is Azure DevTest Labs, which makes it easy to spin up non-production environments. You could do this in other ways, but DevTest Labs gives you some extra capabilities, such as allowing administrators to control costs by setting limits on how many VMs can be deployed at once and ensuring that VMs are shut down when they’re not in use.</p>
<p>One really helpful service for speeding up the responsiveness of your applications is Azure Content Delivery Network, which lets you take advantage of Microsoft’s extensive global network. It caches your most frequently accessed content in locations around the world so your end-users will retrieve it from the closest point on the network. This really helps with making your web applications feel more like local applications.</p>
<p>Although there are billions of computers connected to the internet, they’re dwarfed by the number of other devices connected to the internet, such as smart thermostats or power meters. This is often referred to as the Internet of Things or IoT.</p>
<p>Microsoft offers a suite of services to help organizations connect, monitor, and control IoT devices. The simplest way to get started is to use Azure IoT Central, which is a fully managed SaaS solution that takes care of the technical details for you. It lets you create IoT applications without writing any code.</p>
<p>If you need something more customized, then you can integrate your applications with Azure IoT Hub. It’s a service that handles secure communications with thousands, or even millions, of IoT devices. In fact, it’s the service that IoT Central uses behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Microsoft also offers a solution called Azure Sphere to make your IoT devices more secure. It includes certified chips, the Azure Sphere operating system, and the Azure Sphere Security Service, all of which provide layers of protection for your IoT devices.</p>
<p>When you have a large volume of data coming in, whether it’s from IoT devices or applications, you’ll probably want to perform analytics on it. Microsoft’s analytics offerings have evolved over time, which is why you’ll see a variety of services in this area.</p>
<p>The oldest one is HDInsight. It supports a wide variety of open-source big data frameworks, including Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Storm, and many others. Azure Databricks is a similar service because it runs Spark as well, but it’s more user-friendly and easier to manage than HDInsight. Azure Synapse Analytics is the new version of Azure SQL Data Warehouse. It includes all of the old data warehouse functionality, but it also supports Spark analytics. Have you noticed a common theme? Apache Spark seems to be the king of big data analytics, and it’s just a question of which service you want to use to run it.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated type of analytics is artificial intelligence. You’ve probably heard about the amazing advances in AI that have enabled computers to do everything from language translation to facial recognition to beating humans at games like chess and Go.</p>
<p>Even though AI seems like it must be incredibly complex, the basic idea is fairly simple. The most common method is called machine learning. The way it works is you feed lots of real-world data into a program and the program tries to make generalizations about the data. This is known as training a model. It then uses these generalizations to make predictions when it’s given new data. For example, it can analyze the viewing habits of millions of Netflix customers and make generalizations about the kinds of movies that different types of people like to watch. Then it can look at movies you’ve watched in the past and predict which movie you’d like to watch now. That’s how Netflix makes its recommendations.</p>
<p>Microsoft offers lots of different AI services. If you’re new to AI, then the best place to start is Azure Cognitive Services. This is a collection of pre-built artificial intelligence tools. These services let you add AI capabilities to applications even if you don’t know anything about machine learning.</p>
<p>They’re grouped into five categories: decision, language, speech, vision, and web search. For example, the vision category includes the Computer Vision API, which can classify images, and the Face API, which can detect faces in images.</p>
<p>A related offering is Azure Bot Service, which gives you the tools to create a chatbot. This is an intelligent agent that can answer questions. For example, you could create a chatbot to handle simple support requests from customers.</p>
<p>If you have some basic knowledge of machine learning, then you might want to try Azure Machine Learning Studio. It lets you train and deploy machine learning models without any coding, using a drag-and-drop interface. I highly recommend it for learning the basics of machine learning.</p>
<p>A much more sophisticated option is Azure Machine Learning Services, which gives you full control over every stage of the machine learning process. You can use any Python-based machine learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, train models using services such as Azure Databricks, and deploy models using services such as Azure Kubernetes Service. Azure Machine Learning Services is usually the best solution when you need to build your own custom artificial intelligence application.</p>
<p>The last category I’ll mention is integration tools. Since we use so many applications and services, it would be nice to be able to perform certain tasks on them automatically. For example, suppose you have an Azure blob container that your customer uploads documents to, and you’d like to be notified by email as soon as one arrives so that you can respond to it as quickly as possible. Microsoft offers a service called Azure Logic Apps that lets you automate this sort of task without writing any code. You can create a logic app using a drag-and-drop interface. </p>
<p>In this example, the logic app would be able to detect events that occur in Blob storage, but in most cases, you’d need to use another service called Azure Event Grid to notify your logic app of particular events. For example, if you want to get an email every time a virtual machine is created in a subscription, then you would configure Event Grid to send a message to your logic app whenever this occurs.</p>
<p>These examples are actually pretty trivial. Azure Logic Apps can be used to build complex workflows involving not only Azure services but also third-party services, such as Twitter and Dropbox.</p>
<p>I’ve covered some of the most important Azure services, but there are many more that I didn’t cover. So if you have a need that doesn’t seem to fit with any of these services, there are plenty of other options. First, you can look through Microsoft’s Azure Products page. Another way is to select all services from the main menu in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-portal/">Azure Portal</a> and then search for what you need. If you still can’t find what you’re looking for, then you can search the Azure Marketplace from the search bar at the top of the portal. The Marketplace includes a wide variety of third-party solutions that work with Azure, such as Docker Enterprise or Barracuda Firewall.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s it for my services overview.</p>
<h1 id="Designing-a-Solution"><a href="#Designing-a-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Designing a Solution"></a>Designing a Solution</h1><p>Now that we have a good idea of what <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">services are available in Azure</a>, let’s see how we can put them together to create a more complex solution. One of the best ways to get started is to look at the examples in the Azure Architecture Center. If you click on reference architectures, you’ll see some recommended architectures for particular types of solutions. You can also check out these example workloads for specific business and technical challenges. I’m going to walk you through this e-commerce example.</p>
<p>The scenario in this example is that we need to build an Azure-based solution for customers who want to buy concert tickets. The diagram they use is a bit confusing, so we’ll use our own. </p>
<p>The first service we need to use is Azure App Service because it’s the easiest way to host a web app. To buy concert tickets, our customers will connect to our website, which will be hosted on Azure App Service.</p>
<p>The website won’t be able to do very much, though, until we add more services. For example, it would be pretty difficult to have a continually updated list of concerts without using a database. We could connect our website to a variety of databases, such as MySQL or Cosmos DB. But the most obvious choice is to use Azure SQL database. We can store concert information there and then have a list of upcoming concerts appear on the website.</p>
<p>If we’re going to have a lot of concerts to choose from, then we should also allow customers to search for specific concerts. Azure Cognitive Search is a good choice for that. It indexes your content so it can provide quick responses to search queries.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll want to give customers the ability to purchase tickets. This example solution for Microsoft doesn’t include the actual payment handling part of the transaction, but it does include a couple of the important pieces. First, we’ll want to give customers the option to create an account so they don’t have to re-enter their information every time they use our app to purchase tickets. The good solution is to use Azure Active Directory, B2C. The B2C stands for business to consumer. It provides everything you need to handle authentication for people outside of your organization.</p>
<p>When we receive custom orders, we should put them in a queue. Then we can have a separate component that pulls orders from the queue and processes them. This is one of the best ways to pass data from one component to another because it makes applications more reliable and scalable. Even if a component goes down, the data will be buffered in the queue until that component comes back up. Microsoft has a special type of storage to handle this need, and it’s called, not surprisingly, Queue Storage. It scales up and down as needed.</p>
<p>To retrieve orders from the queue and process them, we can use an Azure Function. The function will be triggered automatically whenever a new item is added to the queue. The function then creates a printable concert ticket for the customer. When it’s done, it stores the ticket in Blob Storage, which is the perfect place for image files. The ticket will then be sent to the customer, although that’s not shown in this example app.</p>
<p>Okay, now we have a complete solution (other than the couple of missing pieces that I mentioned), but we can add more functionality to our app. Another feature we can add is to allow people to post a review after they’ve seen a concert.</p>
<p>This can be handled in a similar way to the order processing feature. We’ll add new concert reviews to another queue and have an Azure Function that retrieves those concert reviews from the queue. And then it will store the reviews in SQL Database so they can be displayed on the website.</p>
<p>All right, now we have all the functionality we need, but we can add some more services to make our app better.</p>
<p>First, we can add Azure Cache for Redis and use it to cache concert information. This will make searches faster when customers are looking for concerts.</p>
<p>Another important way to make our app faster is to use the Azure Content Delivery Network. It’ll cache our website static files, so they’ll come up faster when customers access our site. </p>
<p>Yet another way to improve responsiveness is to use a service called Azure Traffic Manager. If we create multiple copies of our web app and host them in different regions around the world, then we can configure traffic manager to serve each customer from the web app instance that’s closest to the customer on the internet. So now not only do they get the static website files from the closest point on the content delivery network, but they also interact with the web app using the nearest instance.</p>
<p>To ensure that our app is functioning properly, we can use the application insight service. It takes care of monitoring the app and alerting us if there are issues. It also provides us with analytics to help diagnose issues and to understand how users are interacting with our app.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to automatically classify concert reviews as positive or negative, we can use the Text Analytics component of cognitive services. We’ll have an Azure Function that runs a sentiment analysis on each concert review and then updates the concert review in the database to show whether it’s positive or negative.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of services for one application. So how much will everything cost? Thankfully, Microsoft provides sample pricing on the solution example page. It even has options for small, medium, and large implementations, depending on how much customer traffic we think we’ll get. Let’s try the medium option, which can handle up to 100,000 users per month.</p>
<p>This brings up the pricing calculator, which is a really handy feature for estimating the price of nearly any Azure service. I’m going to click the “Collapse all button” so we can see a summary of all the costs. The total is up here. It’s around $900 per month for everything.</p>
<p>If you look through the breakdown of the price, you might be surprised to see that app service is not the number one cost on this list. Considering that it hosts the core application, it seems like it should have the highest cost. But actually Azure Active Directory, B2C, and Azure Cognitive Search are higher. That’s a bit misleading, though, because this pricing example only includes app service hosting in one region. If we want to host the app in multiple regions and use traffic manager to make it more responsive for users around the world, then we’ll pay at least this much for each region, which would easily make app service the most expensive component.</p>
<p>And that’s it for designing a solution.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Services"><a href="#Managing-Services" class="headerlink" title="Managing Services"></a>Managing Services</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/designing-solution/">Building a solution</a> is one thing, but making sure it continues to run properly and cost-efficiently is another. And, of course, you also need to make sure everything is secure and compliant. Fortunately, Microsoft has lots of services to help you with these tasks, too.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor is your one-stop shop for keeping track of what’s happening with your Azure resources. It’s a collection of a variety of monitoring tools. Remember when I mentioned Application Insights in the last lesson? That’s actually just one component of Azure Monitor. Another is Log Analytics, which lets you run complex queries on multiple logs collected from your Azure resources.</p>
<p>But the core features of Azure Monitor are metrics and alerts. Metrics are basically statistics on various aspects of your resources, such as CPU usage on virtual machines and space used on Blob Storage. Azure Monitor creates graphs showing how these metrics have changed over time. It can also watch critical metrics you specify and send you an alert if there’s a problem. For example, it could text you if a database is overwhelmed by a sudden spike in activity.</p>
<p>Microsoft also provides a dashboard called Service Health where you can find out about problems with the Azure platform itself as well as upcoming maintenance events. You can even create alerts so you’ll be notified of both planned and unplanned outages.</p>
<p>Speaking of outages, it’s always a good idea to have backups of your critical resources to help recover from service failures. Most Azure services, such as Cosmos DB, have their own built-in backup capabilities. Azure VMs are a little different because you back them up using a service called Azure Backup. Surprisingly, you can even use this service to back up your on-premises systems.</p>
<p>Even if you’re doing a good job of maintaining your Azure systems, you might still be able to make some improvements. Microsoft provides a very helpful service called Azure Advisor that will not only suggest ways to improve the performance and availability of your applications, but it will even suggest ways to reduce your costs. For example, if it finds underutilized virtual machines, it will recommend that you use smaller (and less expensive) VMs to perform the same tasks.</p>
<p>Azure Advisor also provides security recommendations. It actually gets these recommendations from an important service called Microsoft Defender for Cloud, which was formerly known as Azure Security Center. So if you want to get more details, that’s the place to go. It’s a dashboard that gathers security information from resources across your subscriptions and assesses your vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>First, it shows you your secure score, which is an assessment of how secure your Azure resources are. You can click on it to see a list of recommendations to improve the security of your compute, storage, networking, and identity resources. Each recommendation shows you how much your secure score would be improved if you were to implement the recommendation. You don’t have to implement these recommendations, but it’s usually a good idea.</p>
<p>Then it shows you how well the resources in your Azure subscriptions meet regulatory compliance standards. By default, it will measure your compliance with a set of policies called the Azure Security Benchmark. You can customize these default policies if you want, or you can create your own custom policies from scratch in a service called, naturally, Azure Policy. For example, you could create a policy saying that all storage resources must reside in the European Union, and then if someone in your organization created a storage resource outside of the EU, it would show up in this compliance panel. You can also add other regulatory compliance standards, such as ISO 27001.</p>
<p>Finally, the Workloads protection panel shows you how many security alerts you have. These are potential threats that were detected by Microsoft Threat Intelligence. You can click on it to see the actual alerts so you can address them.</p>
<p>Be aware that only secure score and its recommendations are free. To get the other features, you need to enable enhanced security. This’ll give you lots of additional features as well. One really important feature is the ability to add your on-premises environments to the set of resources that are protected. Another enhanced feature is called just-in-time VM access. This blocks access to a virtual machine until an administrator allows specific users or IP addresses to get in for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>So far in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">this course</a>, I’ve only talked about creating Azure resources manually, but once you’re happy with a particular configuration for a resource, such as a virtual machine, you’ll probably want to create nearly identical resources in a more automated way. The solution is something called an ARM template. ARM is short for Azure Resource Manager.</p>
<p>First, you create an ARM template that specifies all of the configuration details for one or more resources. For example, suppose you create an ARM template for a specific VM configuration. Then, whenever you need to create a VM with those characteristics, you can just run a certain command using that template, and voila, it takes care of all of the details for you. The best part is that Microsoft makes it really easy to create an ARM template. All you have to do is go to an existing resource that has the configuration you want and select “Export template” from the menu.</p>
<p>An even more powerful tool is Azure Blueprints, which lets you automate the deployment of entire Azure environments. A blueprint is a collection of ARM templates plus a few other details, such as policies and user permissions. When a blueprint is assigned to a subscription, it not only automates the creation of an environment, but it also keeps a record of the deployment. This makes it a critical governance tool because it enables the tracking and auditing of deployments.</p>
<p>We’ve covered a lot of Azure management tools, and that’s not even all of them. You can rest assured that Microsoft has the services you need to manage your Azure infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/course-introduction/">learning about Azure</a>. Let’s do a quick review of what you learned.</p>
<p>Azure is a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications, and it runs in Microsoft’s data centers around the world.</p>
<p>Azure’s primary compute offerings are virtual machines, App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure Functions.</p>
<p>In the raw storage area, Microsoft provides Blob storage for unstructured objects, File Storage for traditional file sharing, and Data Lake Storage Gen2 for Hadoop-compatible data analytics.</p>
<p>Azure’s relational database offerings are SQL Database, which is similar to SQL Server, and Azure Database for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL for people who need those particular open source alternatives.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s main NoSQL offering is Cosmos DB. Another NoSQL service is Azure Cache for Redis, which is typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data. </p>
<p>Azure’s equivalent of an on-premises network is a virtual network, or Vnet. You can connect VNets together using VNet peering. To create a secure connection between a VNet and an on-premises network, you can either use a VPN, which stands for Virtual Private Network, or Azure ExpressRoute, which is a dedicated, private connection.</p>
<p>Azure Migrate will help you move applications from your on-premises environment to Azure.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory is a managed identity service that takes care of authentication and integrates with on-premises Active Directory servers.</p>
<p>Azure DevOps can help you automate large portions of the building, testing, and releasing of application updates. Azure DevTest Labs makes it easy to spin up non-production environments.</p>
<p>Azure Content Delivery Network caches your most frequently accessed content in locations around the world so your end-users will retrieve it from the closest point on the network.</p>
<p>Azure IoT Central lets you create Internet of Things applications without writing any code. If you need something more customized, then you can integrate your applications with Azure IoT Hub. Azure Sphere provides extra layers of protection for your IoT devices.</p>
<p>Some of Microsoft’s data analytics services include Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and HDInsight. All of these services can run Apache Spark.</p>
<p>Azure Cognitive Services is a collection of pre-built artificial intelligence tools. Azure Bot Service is a framework for creating chatbots. Azure Machine Learning Studio lets you train and deploy machine learning models without any coding. Azure Machine Learning Services is more sophisticated and gives you full control over every stage of the machine learning process. </p>
<p>Azure Logic Apps lets you automate integration tasks using a drag-and-drop interface.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor is a centralized place for keeping track of what’s happening with your Azure resources. Azure Security Center is a dashboard that gathers security information from your resources and assesses your vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>You can automate your deployments using Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure Blueprints.</p>
<p>You can access Azure using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-portal/">Azure Portal</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-cli/">command-line interface</a>, PowerShell, the Azure Software Development Kit, or the Azure Mobile App. You can run CLI or PowerShell commands in a browser by using Cloud Shell in the Azure Portal.</p>
<p>When you sign up for an Azure account, Microsoft creates both a billing account and a subscription. A billing account can contain multiple subscriptions, each of which contains its own isolated set of resources. Within a subscription, each resource is part of a resource group.</p>
<p>Azure has many regions around the world, and each region contains multiple data centers. You can provide high availability by distributing virtual machines across availability zones, which are in separate data centers.</p>
<p>Whew! I think that’s by far the most times I’ve said the word Azure in one video. Okay, now I’m going to say it just a few more times.</p>
<p>To learn more about Azure, please look through our Azure Library. We have courses, labs, and practice exams on nearly every Azure topic, and we have more content coming out all the time.</p>
<p>Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks and have fun with Microsoft Azure!</p>

          <h1 id="AZ-104-Exam-Preparation-Introduction"><a href="#AZ-104-Exam-Preparation-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="AZ-104 Exam Preparation - Introduction"></a>AZ-104 Exam Preparation - Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to our Microsoft Azure Administrator training. The focus of this learning path is to prepare you for Microsoft’s AZ-104 exam, but even if you’re not going to take the exam, this learning path will help you get started on your way to becoming an Azure administrator.</p>
<p>My name’s Guy Hummel and I’m a Microsoft Certified Azure Expert.</p>
<p>The AZ-104 exam tests your knowledge of five subject areas.</p>
<p>We’ll start with managing Azure identities and governance. The first part of this section is all about Azure Active Directory, which is a managed version of Microsoft’s tried and true directory software for managing users, groups, and other identities. Next, we’ll cover role-based access control. This is how you can give users the right level of access to resources so they don’t have more privileges than they need.</p>
<p>The final topic in this section is managing subscriptions and governance. Aside from learning the basics of working with subscriptions, you’ll also learn how to maintain governance by applying policies to subscriptions and resources. Azure enforces these policies to prevent actions your organization doesn’t want to allow.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll get into implementing and managing storage. This section is, of course, mostly about Azure Storage, including everything from shared access signatures to importing data with the AzCopy tool to configuring storage tiers. It also covers how to centralize file shares using Azure File Sync.</p>
<p>Then you’ll learn how to deploy and manage compute resources. Azure has quite a few different types of compute resources where you can deploy your applications. The traditional way is to use virtual machines. This gives you full control of your servers, but it requires you to maintain them.</p>
<p>Creating a new VM on Azure is pretty easy, but this section shows you how to deploy VMs at an enterprise level. You’ll learn how to set up high availability and autoscaling and also how to automate the deployment of VMs using Azure Resource Manager.</p>
<p>Another approach that’s becoming very popular is to build applications as a collection of microservices. This normally requires the use of containers, such as Docker. If you use containers, then you’ll also need a way to provision, schedule, and manage them. This is also known as container orchestration, and the most popular orchestrator right now is Kubernetes.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to worry about dealing with the underlying compute resources, then you can use Azure App Service. It lets you host web and mobile applications without having to manage the servers that run them. </p>
<p>After that, we’ll go into configuring and managing virtual networks, which is the biggest section of the exam. Again, this is about setting up enterprise-grade networks. You’ll learn how to connect virtual networks together using VNet peering and network gateways, how to configure both private and public DNS zones for name resolution, and how to secure your VNets using Network Security Groups.</p>
<p>We’ll also cover advanced virtual networking. An important part of this section is showing different ways to distribute an application’s load across multiple VMs. One method is to use Azure Load Balancer and another is to use Azure Application Gateway. Azure Load Balancer works at layer 4 of the network stack, so it routes TCP and UDP packets. Azure Application Gateway works at layer 7, so it routes at the HTTP layer. This gives it the ability to do more than Azure Load Balancer. For example, it includes a web application firewall that protects your applications from common exploits, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.</p>
<p>This section also shows you how to do network monitoring using Network Watcher and how to integrate your on-premises network with your Azure network using VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll cover how to monitor and back up Azure resources. The primary service for monitoring is called, not surprisingly, Azure Monitor. You can probably guess the name of the service that performs backups, too. It’s called Azure Backup Service. You’ll also learn about how to create a Recovery Services Vault and how to use Azure Site Recovery.</p>
<p>To get to the next course in this learning path, click on the Learning Path pullout menu on the left side of the page. But please remember to rate this introduction before you go on to the next course. Thanks!</p>

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hi there, welcome to Configuring Azure VNet integration here at Cloud Academy.</p>
<p>My name is Brian Harrison and I’m a Cloud Solution Architect.</p>
<p>Let’s start by doing a quick introduction of both myself as well as the course content before we dive into the deeper networking topics that we’re going to be covering.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, my name is Brian Harrison and I am a Public Cloud Solution Architect. I’ve been working for more than a decade with both Microsoft and Amazon in numerous different capacities focusing on both Infrastructure as a Service as well as Application Development.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links that you can use to get in contact with me should you choose to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/briancharrison">https://twitter.com/briancharrison</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://linkedin.com/in/briancharrison">https://linkedin.com/in/briancharrison</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s also an email address that you can use if you would like to contact Cloud Academy directly and provide you some feedback, or you think some information should be changed: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/introduction/?context_resource=lp&context_id=4445">support@cloudacademy.com</a></p>
<p>Who exactly should attend this course? It’s going to be primarily Azure network engineers, but they can fall into two different categories.</p>
<p>The first are going to be those that work with solution architects, cloud administrators, security engineers, and application developers to deliver Azure Solutions. Those that are more operationally focused.</p>
<p>The second are those that are going to be recommending planning, implementing, and maintaining Azure Network Solutions, maintaining network architectures, primarily those that are going to design and develop networking solutions.</p>
<p>From an objective perspective and also think of this as our agenda, we have three primary topics that we’re going to be covering.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/app-service-vnet-integration/">App Service</a> and how to configure them for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/implementing-vnet-integration-demo/">regional VNet integration</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/azure-kubernetes-service-aks-vnet-integration/">Azure Kubernetes service</a> and how it can be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/aks-setup-demo/">configured for VNet integration</a> as well as the different networking models that are supported within</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/app-service-environment-ase-client-access/">App Service environments</a>, which is a different version of App Services, specifically an isolated version and how you can configure it so that your clients can access those App Services</li>
</ul>
<p>From a prerequisites perspective, there are definitely going to be certain skills that you’ll need to have in place before taking this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expert Azure administration skills. You need to understand the Azure portal the Azure object model and so on</li>
<li>Extensive experience and knowledge of networking, hybrid connections, network security as these are all going to be covered</li>
<li>Subject matter expertise in planning, implementing, and maintaining Azure Network Solutions including routing and private access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, should you have any feedback for Cloud Academy, here is the email address that I showed a little while ago and this is where you can provide both positive and negative feedback about this particular course.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, at the time that I put this course together, I did do a number of demonstrations related to how to do specific configurations. Those demonstrations were using the Azure portal. However, Microsoft is known to make changes to the Azure portal very, very rapidly, so there could be screen changes from the screen grabs that I took versus what you may see live in the Azure portal today. Just be aware of that.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and start talking about Azure App Services and how you would configure them for regional VNet integration.</p>
<h1 id="App-Service-VNet-Integration"><a href="#App-Service-VNet-Integration" class="headerlink" title="App Service VNet Integration"></a>App Service VNet Integration</h1><p>Hi there, let’s continue our discussion of VNet integrations by starting with an overview of the VNet integration with an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">Azure App Service</a>: what the capabilities are, what the features are, and what things you can’t do with respect to App Service VNet integration.</p>
<p>As an overview, the VNet integration gives you access to services within your VNet from your App Service. For example, if you want to maybe make your database more tightly locked down than leveraging a PaaS service, you can place a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-machines-988/what-is-a-virtual-machine/">virtual machine</a> inside of your virtual network and then make your App Service leverage that database, rather than something that has a public endpoint.</p>
<p>The App Service VNet integration does not provide access to your App Service from services inside of your virtual network.</p>
<p>The App Service will still accept public endpoint access, and if you do need to talk to the App Service from within your virtual network, you will need to use that public routing to get there.</p>
<p>Now from a feature and requirements perspective, when you deploy your App Service you will need to take advantage of one of the following tiers of your App Service Plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Tier</li>
<li>One of the versions of Premium Tier</li>
<li>Elastic Premium Tier.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll notice that neither one of the shared tiers are listed: the free or the basic tiers. In addition, the isolated tier is not listed either, because that one is associated with App Service Environments, which we will talk about in a later video.</p>
<p>The VNet integration supports both TCP and UDP traffic when connecting to your virtual network and it works with both standard App Services, whether they be code-based or container-based as well as Function-based App Services for your service connectivity.</p>
<p>I can tell you from my own personal experience that I’ve leveraged the Function app VNet integration, and I’ve done it across ExpressRoute connections to an On-premises network.</p>
<p>A single App Service can connect up to five separate VNets and have them all be integrated at the same time, thereby allowing you to take advantage of services that are in different VNets within the same region as well as in other regions.</p>
<p>With that being a starting point, there are two different kinds of VNet integration. There’s regional, which refers to the App Service and the virtual network being in the same region. Then there is global, where they are in different regions.</p>
<p>Regional requires a dedicated unused subnet. The subnet can’t even have service endpoints associated with it. It has to be completely empty.</p>
<p>For global VNet integration, there is going to be a requirement for a virtual network gateway to be attached to the virtual network that you want to connect to that is in the different region.</p>
<p>What kind of resources can you integrate with or can you access from your App Service? </p>
<ul>
<li>You can access any resource that is sitting in the virtual network itself.</li>
<li>You can access any service endpoint or private endpoint secured service</li>
<li>You can access any resource that is in a peered virtual network, meaning any virtual network that is automatically connected via virtual network peering to the one that the App Service is integrated with.</li>
<li>You can access resources across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/expressroute/">Azure ExpressRoute</a> connections where the ExpressRoute is connected to the virtual network that the App Service is integrated with</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind, in both the Peering scenario as well as the ExpressRoute scenario, you will need to make sure that the traffic does flow in both directions. This is represented by a check box when you set up the peering or is managed by your VPN routing.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at what all of this means, how you would actually set up these configurations inside of the Azure portal, and we’ll do that by looking at App Services first in the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Implementing-VNet-Integration-Demo"><a href="#Implementing-VNet-Integration-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Implementing VNet Integration Demo"></a>Implementing VNet Integration Demo</h1><p>In this video I want us to take a look at the actual configurations for implementing the VNET integration inside of an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">Azure App Service</a>.</p>
<p>To do that, let’s go ahead and jump into the portal and see how you would do it in there, and then you can take that and leverage it inside of a script or continue to do it in the portal.</p>
<p>Here we are at the overview page for my App Service. It is a standard App Service that is running within a standard tier, as you can see right here through the App Service plan tab.</p>
<p>As we talked about, this is one of the requirements for even allowing VNet integration to be possible.</p>
<p>In order to actually configure VNet integration, you’re going to go through the networking tab or networking navigation bar item and just go ahead and click on it.</p>
<p>You’re going to have a number of different options here that will allow you to, set up access restrictions, assign addresses, maybe connect a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-redis-cache-and-cdn-in-azure/using-rediscache-and-cdn-in-azure-how-azure-cdn-works/">CDN</a>, but the key point is VNet integration.</p>
<p>As you can see right now it’s currently set to off. </p>
<p>We click on that.</p>
<p>We bring up the page to show us that right now no VNets have been currently integrated. </p>
<p>I have two Vnets in my subscription. One in this region where this App Service lives, which is South Central, and then I have one that sits inside of North Central.</p>
<p>The process for configuring your App Service is going to be the same no matter whether it’s regional or global. The difference is on the VNet side, and we’ll take a look at the VNet configuration options in the next video.</p>
<p>All we’re going to do here is click on the add VNet button. </p>
<p>It’s going to give us an option to choose our subscription.</p>
<p>Then we’re going to choose the virtual network.</p>
<p>Here is the one that’s currently sitting in the same region, South Central, and then we’re going to specify do we want to go ahead and create a new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-azure-network-security/ip-addresses-subnets/">subnet</a> that’s going to be dedicated for this App Service or do we want to use one that’s existing?</p>
<p>I already have an empty one and it’s called Subnet App Services, so we’re going to choose that one.</p>
<p>Click OK and now all we have to do is wait for the configuration to finish and there it is.</p>
<p>We’ve got it up and running and now the VNet integration has been enabled, which you can see right here.</p>
<p>We can also see the address space which should correspond to the address space of the subnet that we chose and can validate that we are in fact connected to VNet integrations.</p>
<p>It’s that simple. You can do this via the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-azure-services/using-azure-cli/">Azure CLI</a>. You can also do it via Azure PowerShell, but it is usually a one-time action, so I can’t imagine that you’re going to need to do this all that often.</p>
<p>In the next video, we’ll take a look at how to configure the actual virtual network so that it can receive an App Service integration.</p>
<h1 id="VNet-Setup-Demo"><a href="#VNet-Setup-Demo" class="headerlink" title="VNet Setup Demo"></a>VNet Setup Demo</h1><p>Hi there. In this video, we’re going to be focusing on the VNet and the configurations that are required the VNet and the configurations that are required in order for an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">App Service</a> to integrate with it and we’ll take a look at both a regional version as well as a global version. But before we do that, let’s take a look at some specific features that are allowed inside of your virtual network that you can actually use from a networking perspective.</p>
<p>So, for example, once your network has been integrated with your App Service, you absolutely can prevent or allow traffic using network security group rules for that App Service for what services, VMs, what have you, it can actually talk to successfully once that traffic has entered in. Any kind of routing that you would want to implement. Maybe you want to make sure that traffic that comes from that App Service runs through intrusion detection&#x2F;intrusion prevention, maybe you want it to run through a web application firewall.</p>
<p>There are any number of different possibilities for how you might want to route that traffic in order for you to make sure that traffic is correct, you can absolutely implement user-defined routing, whether that be application routing or network routing. You can absolutely use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/azure-network-connectivity-name-resolution/azure-dns/">Azure Private DNS</a> Zones.</p>
<p>So, once that integration has been implemented, if you want to allow access to a service inside of that virtual network from the App Service, there is absolutely no reason why you can’t define the name of that service in your virtual network using Azure Private DNS Zones and the App Service because the integration has been implemented or connected, we’ll be able to see where that service exists and be able to resolve it correctly.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and jump on into the Azure portal and let’s take a look at both of the virtual networks that I have deployed and the integrations or configurations that I have set within them. The first one that we’ll take a look at is the South Central or the regional virtual network that’s in the same region as our App Service and this is just the overview page. The key configuration here is within the subnets. Once we look in the subnets, the primary requirement, as I talked about at the beginning, is to make sure that you have a dedicated subnet just for the App Service. And you can actually see that here under Delegated 2, there is a Microsoft.Web&#x2F;ServerFarms. That corresponds to the resource provider for App Services. That corresponds to the resource provider for App Services. Don’t get worried about that name. That name has been around for an extremely long time, and it is extremely difficult to change those names, hence why it is still in existence. But you can absolutely see that your App Service has been integrated with this particular subnet.</p>
<p>Now, remember I talked about the ability to leverage other types of PaaS services to leverage other types of PaaS services that have been connected to your virtual network. So, if we were to actually go to our subnet endpoints, for example, I absolutely– and I absolutely have one here configured for a service endpoint for Microsoft.SQL. I could very easily add KeyVault, Event Hub, Cognitive Services. Any of those that you want to take advantage of and access from your App Service, you can do that by creating the necessary service endpoints and allow the traffic to flow through your virtual network, maybe for those reasons that I talked about earlier where you want your traffic to be routed through intrusion detection prevention, web application firewalls, things like that. That would be a reason for routing that traffic through to virtual network to a service endpointed-based service. And Microsoft has been over the years adding more and more services, PaaS-based services, to this list.</p>
<p>Now, you can also route your traffic or connect to private endpoint-based services. Those actually don’t show up here. The private endpoints are associated directly with the individual, say Microsoft.SQL or Azure.PostGreSQL or Azure.MySQL when you create those private endpoints and those private endpoints have been connected to the virtual network, then you’ll be able to connect to those CNAME records associated with those services appropriately.</p>
<p>Now, on the global virtual network side, I have a separate virtual network that is sitting in North Central US and the big key thing here, right here on the overview page to see, is that I have a connected device called my VNet gateway. This is the required piece that needs to be in place in order for a global App Service VNet integration to exist in order for a global App Service VNet integration to exist because you’re actually going to connect to the VNet gateway first before the App Services traffic can actually make it into the virtual network.</p>
<p>When you create your virtual network gateway, you will define which virtual network you’re going to connect to. If you do not already have a gateway subnet created, it will create one for you and create the necessary IP range associated with it and then the network gateway will be attached. The Virtual Network Gateway does have some requirements with respect to how it is configured in order to allow for the App Service VNet integration to work, so let’s take a quick look at that.</p>
<p>The big key thing here is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/vpn-gateways/">VPN</a> type. It needs to be a route-based VPN and then, of course, it needs to be connected to the virtual network. A public IP address will be created automatically unless you already have one existing, of course, and it will be that public IP address that the App Service actually connects to in order to access the virtual network. In addition, there is one other set of configurations and that’s the point to site configurations. In here you need to define an address pool that can be given to any client that connects to the virtual network gateway and it needs to be an address pool that is not going to overlap with the gateway subnet’s address pool.</p>
<p>So, the address pool for the virtual network is in the 10. range. We needed to do something that was not in the 10. range, so I chose 192.168. In addition, you need a tunnel type to be of SSTP and the authentication type should be Azure certificate. But according to the documentation, you do not actually need to upload a cert, you just need to specify that as the authentication type. Once you’ve done those things, you should be able to connect to your virtual network via the VNet integration section that we showed in the last video for your App Service configurations. That should do it.</p>
<p>App Service VNet integration is not very difficult. It works extremely well, as I mentioned. I’ve implemented it with some of my customers in the past and I definitely recommend it. In the next set of videos, we’re gonna start to take a look at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-1268/introduction/">Azure Kubernetes service</a> and how to integrate it within the scope of a virtual network in order to privatize that deployment.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS-VNet-Integration"><a href="#Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS-VNet-Integration" class="headerlink" title="Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) VNet Integration"></a>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) VNet Integration</h1><p>In this video, we’re going to start by taking a look at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-1268/introduction/">Azure Kubernetes service</a> and how it is going to integrate into a Virtual Network inside of your Azure subscription.</p>
<p>Azure Kubernetes service is a very different beast than Azure App Services and the reasoning behind that is: although it is absolutely considered Platform as a Service, Microsoft manages only a portion of it. It gets deployed as Infrastructure as a Service, therefore giving you more control over the environment than an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">Azure App Service</a> does. It also means that it gives you more networking integration capabilities.</p>
<p>Let’s start by understanding exactly what are the resources that you’re going to be leveraging for an Azure Kubernetes cluster, when that cluster gets deployed. </p>
<p>The first is of course a Virtual Network, which is in fact required. The Virtual Network can either be manually attached to or automatically created depending upon the networking model that you’re going to choose, and we’ll talk about that in a little bit. </p>
<p>Of course, there is going to need to be a load balancer to allow for scalability. The minimum recommended cluster size for Azure Kubernetes is typically three VMs, so that load balancer will need to be there at a minimum in order for Kubernetes just to work, let alone support your application.</p>
<p>Network Security Groups should absolutely be applied to the subnets that your cluster is placed into in order to prevent traffic that should not be flowing.</p>
<p>The basis of Azure Kubernetes is going to be the virtual machines which provide the nodes for your Azure Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>If you are going to provide any kind of scaling for your Kubernetes cluster, maybe you know that your user base is going to shrink and grow over time, then you’re going to want to take advantage of VM scale sets to allow that cluster to grow and shrink.</p>
<p>I talked about the fact that Kubernetes, when deployed inside of Azure, supports two different networking models. The first is called Kubenet and this is the default Kubernetes model that most customers are used to. If they’re deploying Kubernetes either On-Premises or in another cloud service provider, it does the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>it conserves IP address space</li>
<li>It uses a Kubernetes internal and external load balancer for reaching of pods </li>
<li>It allows the manual managing and maintaining of user-defined routes </li>
<li>It provides for a maximum of 400 nodes per cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what is built into the Kubernetes engine.</p>
<p>Microsoft has provided a second networking model called the Azure CNI which adds IP addresses to the pods as well as the nodes. Of course, this means that all of your network IP addresses are going to need to be extremely well defined before implementing your cluster, depending upon how many nodes you believe are going to be deployed within that cluster and how many pods within those nodes. </p>
<p>In this model, the pods get full <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/course-introduction/">Virtual Network</a> connectivity and can be directly reached via their private IP address from connected networks. This requires a much larger IP address space, and much better planning.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes case, this is a sample diagram of what a Kubernetes implementation would look like.</p>
<p>You have individual nodes that have actual IP addresses. These are 192.168.* ranges and they are the IP addresses of the Virtual Network. Then you’ll notice that there is a set of 10.* IP address associated with the pods. These are the internal IP address ranges that Kubernetes is leveraging in order for the services to talk to one another within Kubernetes, but those IP addresses are not published to the rest of the virtual network for anyone to access them individually.</p>
<p>The difference with Azure CNI is going to be that the pod IP addresses would have a 192.168 IP address range, just like the nodes do.</p>
<p>What are the differences between the two networking models?</p>
<p>Both networking models support automatic configuration of VNet resources if you choose to. They also both support manual creation and attachment of VNet resources which is partially true. </p>
<p>What I mean by that is when you go through the Azure wizard, if you choose Kubenet as your networking model, you will automatically have a VNet created for you. You cannot attach Kubernetes to an existing VNet through the wizard. If you do it through the CLI or PowerShell, you do have more control. Manual creation and attachment is going to be available for the Azure CNI by default. However, you do have the ability to automatically create one as well. </p>
<p>With respect to network policies for Azure Kubernetes service, they can be defined and changes can be made through both models. </p>
<p>Manual VNet resource creation allows for user-defined routes and service endpoint configurations whereas automatic VNet resource creation prevents those configurations. So in the Kubenet case, if you’re going through the wizard, when the VNet gets created, there will be User Defined Routes automatically set up to allow for Kubernetes to leverage the cube Kubenet model. </p>
<p>In an Azure CNI case where the IP addresses are now attached to the pods, you are the only one that is going to know what the requirements are for a User Defined Route based on how the pods are going to communicate. </p>
<p>When should you use the different networking models? </p>
<p>If the following scenarios are true, the Kubenet should be the right networking model for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a limited IP address space</li>
<li>Most of the pod communication is internal to the cluster</li>
<li>You don’t need advanced features of AKS like virtual nodes or Azure network policy</li>
<li>If you have a very solid understanding of your application </li>
<li>The pods or the services associated with your application are not going to be either spoken to individually or doing a lot of outbound address talking</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if your networking is being managed by a separate team and they are controlling IP address availability, that’s another reason for choosing Kubenet over Azure CNI.</p>
<p>The reverse scenarios are going to be true, for Azure CNI to be the right mode for you. The following should be what you are looking for: </p>
<ul>
<li>You have available IP addresses for both the nodes in the pods </li>
<li>Most of the pod communication is to resources outside of the cluster rather than strictly internal</li>
<li>You don’t want to manage user-defined routes when you specify Azure CNI, the user-defined routes are not only created for you automatically, but they’re actually managed by Azure automatically as well.</li>
<li>You also don’t need advanced features.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you can leverage advanced features with Azure CNI if you choose to.</p>
<p>There are definitely a number of differences between the networking models. I’m not going to go through each line of the table with the slide deck, but here are a few standouts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pod to pod connectivity is absolutely supported in both models</li>
<li>Access to resources secured by service endpoints, meaning PaaS services that have been privatized to your virtual network is supported in both models</li>
<li>One thing that is not supported in both models is support for Windows node pools rather than Linux node pools. Kubenet does not support Windows node pools whereas Azure CNI does today</li>
<li>You can deploy a cluster into existing or new virtual networks in both models</li>
</ul>
<p>Just make sure to understand the similarities and differences before you make a decision on which networking model you want to implement.</p>
<p>In the next video, we’ll take a look at how to specify these network integrations for AKS by leveraging the Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="AKS-Setup-Demo"><a href="#AKS-Setup-Demo" class="headerlink" title="AKS Setup Demo"></a>AKS Setup Demo</h1><p>In this video I want us to continue our conversation about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-1268/introduction/">Azure Kubernetes service</a> and specifically how it’s going to integrate into your VNet. The best way to see that is to walk through the Creation wizard for an Azure Kubernetes cluster and see what their requirements are in that wizard for creating the cluster and putting it into an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/course-introduction/">Azure virtual network</a>. </p>
<p>We are in the Azure portal and I have already kicked off the Azure Kubernetes cluster creation wizard and I’ve already filled in some of the fields that aren’t really relevant to networking at all.</p>
<p>Things like specifying a resource group, giving the cluster a name, choosing a region, availability zones, version of Kubernetes, those kinds of things aren’t necessarily specific to networking.</p>
<p>Once we start to Scroll down, we then can specify manual or auto-scaling for the method of scaling for your cluster. Not everybody needs scaling at all for their Kubernetes cluster. If they know their application, they know the user base for that particular application and they can set up a cluster that is going to just maintain that application, then auto-scaling may not be needed.</p>
<p>Hence using the manual scale method where you’re actually going to specify a static value.</p>
<p>However, if you are going to provide scalability and elasticity for your application to allow for your user base to shrink and grow over time, you’re going to want to specify a minimum and maximum node count range.</p>
<p>I’m bringing this up because although most people would not consider this a networking issue.</p>
<p>For the Azure CNI based networking model it is going to be important because you’re going to need to allocate IP addresses for the nodes as well as the pods, so making sure to prepare and understand how many potential IP addresses you’re going to need for your cluster is going to be extremely important.</p>
<p>The next tab we’re going to take a look at is Node pools. This also ties back into the exact same discussion I was just mentioning, which is you start off with an agent pool which is primarily running the orchestration engine of Kubernetes and then maybe you want to separate out your workload or your application into a separate node pool.</p>
<p>You could absolutely do that, so if you’ll remember, I said three to six for the minimum and maximum scaling. Maybe the first three are going to be your agent pool. The remaining three will be your application pool. Again, this ties back into the number of IP addresses that you’re going to need in your virtual network if you are using Azure CNI.</p>
<p>You can also turn on Azure virtual nodes which connects your cluster to Azure container instances. That is a very advanced feature and is not specific to this discussion, but I just wanted to mention it.</p>
<p>Lastly on the tab, if you are in fact using scaling, you’re going to automatically check the enable virtual machine scale sets so that you can specify how that scaling is going to be managed. Whether it be via processor percentage or queue length or any number of different health checks that can be performed against your cluster.</p>
<p>Next tab is on authentication. I’m just going to go ahead and skip past this, because this has no bearing on networking.</p>
<p>Now we have the networking tab, and this is where you’re going to specify a number of different things. You’re going to specify which network configuration you’re going to choose, the Kubenet or Azure CNI. If you are going to choose Azure CNI then you have the ability to either select a new or existing virtual network.</p>
<p>Now, because of the particular region that I chose at the beginning in the Basics tab, I do not have any existing virtual networks in this region. However, if I had chosen a different region, say, and actually, let’s go ahead and go back and do that. Let’s choose South Central and then go back to the networking tab. I should now have an available VNet that I can actually place the cluster into. </p>
<p>The minute that I do that you’ll notice I’ve got some error messages. They are letting me know that because of the fact that I’m using Azure CNI, that my subnet IP ranges are not large enough to support the node pools and then eventuality of the pods running in those node pools. You need to have a minimum of 555 addresses. Therefore, the &#x2F;24 is not going to do it for me. I’m going to need something in the neighborhood of probably a &#x2F;20. That’s what happens when you choose Azure CNI.</p>
<p>If we specify Azure Kubenet, then the only thing we need to specify is a DNS name prefix. It’s going to choose a load balancer. We’re going to specify any HTTP application routing, whether or not this should be a private cluster, meaning that the load balancer would have a private IP address rather than a public one, and do we want to set authorized IP address ranges.</p>
<p>You’ll notice there is no selection here for the choosing of an existing or new virtual network.</p>
<p>In this instance, it’s going to automatically create a virtual network for you, and then you’ll have access to modify it or configure it afterward, but the virtual network will get created for you by default. </p>
<p>Lastly, do you want to specify any network policies? The default is none, but you can absolutely specify Calico. However, the Azure network policy is not compatible with Kubenet. If you chose Azure CNI, then the Azure network policy option would be available.</p>
<p>That is really all that there is with respect to VNet integrations.</p>
<p>Once you have your cluster up and running, you can absolutely set your default user-defined routes. You can create additional network security groups and have them all be applied inside of the virtual network, but this is going to be the minimum configuration that you’re going to start with when you create your cluster. </p>
<p>It’s then going to be dependent on your specific application requirements as to what additional services and features you need to integrate into that environment.</p>
<p>In the next set of videos, we’re going to take a look at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">App Services</a> and, specifically application service environments and how they can be integrated to provide a private PaaS App Service instance inside of your virtual network.</p>
<h1 id="App-Service-Environment-ASE-Client-Access"><a href="#App-Service-Environment-ASE-Client-Access" class="headerlink" title="App Service Environment (ASE) Client Access"></a>App Service Environment (ASE) Client Access</h1><p>In this last video, we’re going to cover <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-app-service-949/introduction/">App Service</a> environments and specifically how your clients will access them. </p>
<p>App Service environments are slightly different from a standard public-facing App Service which we talked about in the first few videos. Let’s start by really asking what actually is an application service environment or an ASE is.</p>
<p>First of all, it is still an App Service, and it has all of the same capabilities and features that a standard App Service does, meaning that it is a PaaS service and Microsoft is in fact going to be managing it. However, it gets deployed into an Isolated Tier based App Plan and as such when it does get created, Microsoft is going to ask you for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/course-introduction/">Virtual Network</a> that it can be placed into and it exists solely within that virtual network.</p>
<p>All of the other features and capabilities of the App Service still apply, but now instead of it having a public IP address and a public name, it is going to exist inside of your virtual network, and it will have a CNAME that Microsoft applies, but it will only be accessible from within that Virtual Network until you define otherwise. It can have both internal and external endpoints, but most customers that I have worked with have used it strictly for internal purposes or they have created a public endpoint using another device such as a network virtual appliance, Azure Application Gateway or the like and it can allow for both inbound and outbound traffic.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll remember correctly from the App Service VNet integration we talked about in the first few videos, the App Service only had the ability to talk into services inside of the virtual network, not the reverse. Services inside of the virtual network could not talk to the App Service or could not instigate traffic with the App Service. Only the App Service could instigate traffic with services in the VNet. </p>
<p>With an Application Service Environment, the traffic can be instigated in both ways. Both internal services and the Application Service Environment can see one another.</p>
<p>From a client access perspective, you’re going to access the application service environment in much the same way that you do with any infrastructure as a service-based solution. </p>
<p>You can allow for port forwarding from a jump box or Azure Bastion for example.</p>
<p>You can allow for traffic through an internal or external load balancer. Remember, App Services have a load balancer attached to them by default to allow for scalability. You can define whether that load balancer will have a private endpoint or a public endpoint, and Microsoft does supply different CNAMEs for each specific solution. </p>
<p>You can use User Defined Routes for any traffic coming in and out of that App Service. So if you want the traffic to go through an intrusion detection&#x2F;prevention device or a web application firewall, you can absolutely force that. </p>
<p>The one key factor that a lot of my customers have done over the years is they have created these App Services to reduce the amount of administration overhead and allowed their internal users on their internal networks On-Premises to be able to access these App Services via an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-networks-1207/expressroute/">ExpressRoute</a>.</p>
<p>So, there’s any number of different options for accessing the App Service, but the key factor here is that the App Service is still in App Service. It’s just now isolated, and network secured like an infrastructure as a service-based solution would be.</p>
<p>With that, we’ll wrap up the course with a conclusion video. Hope you’ve enjoyed this and I hope to see you soon.</p>
<h1 id="Wrap-Up"><a href="#Wrap-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap-Up"></a>Wrap-Up</h1><p>Let’s do a quick wrap-up of what we’ve discussed here within our course. </p>
<p>We covered how to set up integration with your public-facing App Service so that the App Service can talk to resources inside of a virtual network and we’ve done it where both the App Service and the virtual network are in the same region. </p>
<p>We also did talk about how to set up a global based integration, but that wasn’t really the focus of this particular course. </p>
<p>We also covered the networking options for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/azure-kubernetes-service-aks-vnet-integration/">Azure Kubernetes service</a>, specifically Kubenet and Azure CNI, as well as some of the pluses and minuses for each one. Why you wouldn’t want to use them and so on. </p>
<p>Lastly, we talked about how you would take an Azure App Service and turn it into an App Service Environment, also called an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/configuring-azure-vnet-integration-2345/app-service-vnet-integration/">isolated App Service</a>. Once it was created, how would your clients access that app service from the outside? </p>
<p>In addition to the information that I’ve provided in the course, I always like to provide some additional links to documentation that Microsoft provides should you want to look at any of these topics in more detail. The links that you see in the deck can be found down below in the course material section of the course. Each one of these links do take you to a documentation page related to each one of the topics we discussed: </p>

          <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to the Design and Implement Service Endpoints course here at Cloud Academy. My name’s Brian Harrison, and I’ll be your instructor throughout the videos of this course. Let’s start with a quick introduction of both myself as well as some information about what you can expect from the content of this particular course. As I mentioned, my name is Brian Harrison, and I’m a Public Cloud Solution Architect. I’ve been working in the Cloud Space for more than a decade now, working primarily with both Amazon and Microsoft. </p>
<p>Microsoft being my specialty as I was a Cloud Solution Architect with them for about five years. Here are a number of ways that you can get in contact with me should you have any questions or just want to talk about any of the content. In addition, there is a email right there <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#99;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#97;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#99;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#97;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> that you can use to contact Cloud Academy directly if you should have any feedback questions or concerns about the course. Now, who exactly should be attending this course? First of all, it’s going to be Azure Network Engineers that are going to be working with solution architects, cloud administrators, security engineers, and application developers to deliver Azure solutions. </p>
<p>Also, Azure Network Engineers that are going to be recommending, planning, implementing, and maintaining Azure network solutions. They are typically two different individuals within a given organization, hence why I separated them. The primary objectives of this course are going to be to talk about creating service endpoints, configuring endpoint policies, thereby allowing you to minimize the traffic to specific endpoints, configure service tags, and then leveraging service tags among other things to control the access to the individual service endpoints and the past services that are sitting behind them. Some of the prerequisites that you should be aware of before starting this course: You should be an expert Azure administrator and have expert Azure administration skills. In other words, you should be able to very quickly and easily jump in and out of the Azure portal without any problem and know exactly where you’re going at all times. </p>
<p>Extensive experience and knowledge of networking, hybrid connections, and network security; that’s going to be a base knowledge before we can even start to talk about service endpoints, so you need to have that. And then have subject matter expertise in planning, implementing, and maintaining Azure network solutions, including routing and private access. Again, if you should have any feedback for Cloud Academy, you can absolutely send them an email at <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x40;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#100;&#x65;&#x6d;&#121;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x40;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#100;&#x65;&#x6d;&#121;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>. </p>
<p>Now, one thing to be aware of is I will be using screenshots and data that were current at the time of the building of this course. Microsoft can make changes at any point in time with respect to updates to individual services such as service endpoints. So, when I call out things like something is in public preview today, it could be generally available by the time that you watch this and therefore the Azure portal could have changed. So, with that, let’s go ahead and jump on into the content and start to talk about how to create service endpoints.</p>
<h1 id="Create-Service-Endpoints"><a href="#Create-Service-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Create Service Endpoints"></a>Create Service Endpoints</h1><p>Hi there. Let’s start our discussion around service endpoints by talking about how to create them. But even before we talk about that, let’s make sure that we understand what service endpoints are and what the key features are for them. So, with respect to a service endpoint, you are going to get secure direct connectivity to Azure PaaS services. Okay, that’s great. But Azure PaaS services already have secure connectivity options because they are almost all SSL-based. But they allow secure connections to those Azure PaaS services from within your virtual network. Well, that’s also already available as long as you allow outbound connectivity from your virtual network, then any virtual machine or Azure Kubernetes service could access those PaaS services from within the virtual network, the traffic would of course just go out to the Internet.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle, it allows Azure private IP addresses from within the virtual network to reach the endpoint of the Azure service without needing a Public IP and without needing outbound Internet connectivity. The traffic will stay inside of the Azure region if both services are in the same region, or it will stay on the Azure backbone if the services are in two different regions. Now there are a lot of Azure PaaS services that are available. Not all of them are currently supported with respect to service endpoints. Here is the current list. Everything from Azure Storage, different databases, data analytics services, event messaging services, app services, cognitive services, and currently in public preview Azure container registry, I definitely will see that becoming generally available here very soon. Now, what are the key features with respect to our service endpoints? The first is improved security, absolutely.</p>
<p>You no longer have to worry about traffic going out to the Internet and therefore potentially being sniffed, or grabbed, or any of those kinds of things. All of the traffic stays inside of Microsoft’s regions, inside of Microsoft’s backbone. You can provide optimal routing for your Azure service traffic from your virtual network, therefore getting better performance. You can also control the routing of the traffic and use any base routing that you currently already have in place for other services. So, all traffic will travel to the service on the Azure backbone, I’ve mentioned this already. All Internet traffic forcing routes will work as expected. So, for example, should you have a route, user-defined route within your virtual network that forces all traffic to go through an intrusion detection, intrusion prevention device, or through a web application firewall, for example,</p>
<p>you can still leverage those routes to have that be the first endpoint for all traffic before going to the Azure service, thereby making sure that that traffic is both secure and clean. It is very simple to set up with much less required overhead than would be required if you were to allow for traffic to go out to the Internet and then to the Azure PaaS service, you would have to require many more network security group rules, maybe in that gateway, things along those lines. Whereas, these are not required if you’re going to be using service endpoints.</p>
<p>No Public IP addresses are required as I mentioned earlier. And as I just talked about, no NAT or Gateway devices are required because the traffic stays in the Azure backbone, you no longer have to worry about this outbound Internet traffic requirement. Now, the last thing to make sure that we understand is what are the permissions required for someone who is going to configure service endpoints for your virtual network?</p>
<p>The first is, for existing virtual networks, with existing subnets, just write access. That’s all that the user will need in order to be able to make the necessary configuration changes. However, if they are creating a new subnet, and in creating that new subnet they are also going to be adding a service endpoint capability, then they will also need the joinViaServiceEndpoint&#x2F;action permission for any of those new additional subnets. Now, in the next video, let’s take a look at an actual demonstration of how to create or configure your service endpoints for an existing virtual network.</p>
<h1 id="Configure-Service-Endpoints-Demo"><a href="#Configure-Service-Endpoints-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Configure Service Endpoints Demo"></a>Configure Service Endpoints Demo</h1><p>Hi there. Let’s take what we just learned about service endpoints and actually apply it inside the Azure Portal by configuring an existing virtual network to support service endpoints. Here we are in a virtual network that I created called vnet-serviceendpoints. And I’m currently in the subnets area of this virtual network. You’ll notice it already has an existing subnet called defaultSubnet. Anytime you create a new virtual network, you’re going to be required to add a existing subnet. So, what I’m going to do is I’m going to add a second subnet and we’re going to configure it to support service endpoints. We’re going to click on the ‘Add Subnet’ button, that of course brings up then the add subnet blade. </p>
<p>I’m going to just call this subnetEndpoints. I’ll go ahead and leave the address range alone, that’s perfectly fine. The next few items are going to be specific to subnet networking, so we’re not going to focus on them; the NAT gateway, the Network security group, and the Route table. Now, as I talked about with respect to the features, you no longer will need a NAT gateway to support service endpoint access or past service access. You may still want to add in network security groups, that’s going to be up to you. And as I talked about, if you already have route tables in place where you want to force traffic to another device before going to the past service, you absolutely can do so. </p>
<p>But the key area is down here under the service endpoints heading. And what we’re going to do is specify a specific set of services that are allowed to be accessed directly over the Azure backbone from any VMs, Azure kubernetes, app services that might have been deployed into this subnet in the future. As soon as we click on the list, it’s going to open up and give us access to all of the existing services that are supported and these tied back to that list that I showed you a little while ago. </p>
<p>Now, I’m going to choose ‘keyVault’ and I’m going to choose ‘Storage’. That’s all that I have to do. I don’t need to do anything more. Now, anytime I try and access a keyVault service or a storage service from a VM inside of this subnet, that traffic will stay on the Azure backbone within the Azure region if both are in the same region, and so on. That’s all that I need to do, nothing more. Now, there is one additional item here called endpoint policies. We do not have any of those currently. That is a separate topic for the next video. We’ll talk about that then. And I’ll then come back and show you how to apply endpoint policies to this same subnet once we’re done. Now, one thing to keep in mind here, for all of these service types, this just allows the traffic to stay inside of Azure. </p>
<p>This does not affect permissioning or access to any specific instance of keyVault or storage. Almost every one of these services listed here have their own additional security controls, and you will still need to meet those before traffic will flow into the service. An example, Microsoft storage has an additional set of lifecycle policies that can be applied to individual containers or the storage account as a whole. You will still need to be allowed through that gate before you can actually retrieve data from that storage account. This only applies to the routing of the traffic to the services listed here. This is all that’s needed for service endpoints. </p>
<p>The same thing is true for an existing subnet. So, let me go ahead and save this. Now that the subnet has been added, let’s take a look at our existing subnet and see that the way to add additional services to this subnet is exactly the same. We’re going to click on ‘CosmosDB’, I’ll click on ‘EventHub’, and just that simple. I now have two additional services that are added to this existing subnet. The exact same process is valid. Click ‘Save’ and we’re done. Now, we go back and check out subnet endpoints that we just created, and you’ll see, I now have keyVault and Storage added here as successful service endpoints. That’s all there is to it. </p>
<p>In the next video, we’ll take a look at the service endpoint policies and how to create them, what they’re going to be used for, and then of course, how to apply them to your subnet.</p>
<h1 id="Configure-Service-Endpoint-Policies"><a href="#Configure-Service-Endpoint-Policies" class="headerlink" title="Configure Service Endpoint Policies"></a>Configure Service Endpoint Policies</h1><p>Hi there. In this video, we’re going to take our discussions of service endpoints a step further by talking about service endpoint policies, but first, we need to understand what are they?</p>
<p>And how can they be leveraged within the scope of your virtual network? The first thing to understand is that a service endpoint policy is a way for you to filter the egress traffic that leaves your virtual network and travels to a Azure storage account that’s been configured via a service endpoint. Now, this means that you’re going to be providing allow and deny traffic rules to specific storage accounts, and there are different mechanisms for defining what those storage accounts are, you don’t have to necessarily just pick and choose individual ones. Network security groups can limit traffic but only to specific regions. Whereas in a service endpoint, you’re going to be able to filter your traffic to anywhere that’s in a resource group, that’s in the subscription, and in some cases even across multiple tenants. It replaces the need for network virtual appliances to filter your traffic, but only filtering the traffic on a specific allow or deny definition.</p>
<p>If you need more tight filtering or packet management or things along those lines, then the NVAs may still be required. One thing to be aware of here, there is no centralized logging currently for the use of endpoint policies, meaning that you’re not going to be able to go back and validate that traffic did not flow to storage account A but did flow to storage account B. Now, here is what a JSON example would look like for a service endpoint policy definition. You’re going to give it a name, you’re going to specify a resource group where the policy is going to be deployed, and then of course you’re going to specify the service. Right now, Microsoft. Storage is the only service that is available for endpoint policies. And then you’re going to define a specific service that is allowed. In this case, we have chosen a specific storage account called mystgacc. And I limited the string here by putting in three dots so that you don’t necessarily need to see the full subscription id, the resource group name, things along those lines, that is what gets filled into that little three-dot section. And then, of course, we need to define the resource provider that this JSON is being created for.</p>
<p>Now, this is just a JSON example. In the next video, we will be doing a demonstration of how to create an endpoint policy inside of the Azure portal so that you can see that as well. But this is what you would be using if you were using the Azure CLI or Azure Power Shell. Now, some configuration considerations to keep in mind. The endpoint policies are applied on the subnet where the service endpoint is configured and you should have seen that in the previous video when we did the demonstration of how to configure service endpoints, but we’ll do it again in the next video. You are allowed to add specific storage accounts to an allow list. Now as I mentioned, there are a number of different ways that those can be defined. They can be all storage accounts in the specific subscription, all storage accounts in a specific resource group, or you can pick and choose individual storage accounts, and again I’ll show this to you in the next video. By default, no policies are configured on a subnet, which means that all storage accounts are available by default.</p>
<p>It isn’t until you apply a policy that you start to limit everything that has not been specified in that policy. Multiple policies can be applied to each subnet, you are not limited to just one. If a storage account is allowed within a policy, then one thing to be aware of is if that storage account has been configured to be read-only geographic redundancy, then the secondary account will also be allowed for access. So, as an example, read access geographic redundant. If your storage account is RA-GRS and you have applied it in East US, then of course the read accessible secondary is going to be in West US. Standard regional pairings that Azure’s had in place for a decade now. If you allow that storage account to be accessible via the policy, then the west region secondary will be accessible as well.</p>
<p>And then lastly, storage accounts specified within the policy can be in different subscriptions or different tenants as long as you the user have access to those storage accounts to be able to see them from a configuration perspective. If you can’t see them, then you can’t define them, at least from an Azure portal perspective. Now, obviously, if you can write a JSON that defines those storage accounts that are in a different subscription or a different tenant, then that will work as well. In the next video, we’ll take a look at how to demo or demonstrate the configuration of both the endpoint policy creation as well as applying it to a individual subnet.</p>
<h1 id="Endpoint-Policies-Demo"><a href="#Endpoint-Policies-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Endpoint Policies Demo"></a>Endpoint Policies Demo</h1><p>Hi, there. In this video, we’re going to wrap up the discussion around endpoint policies by taking a look at a demonstration of one, how to create one, as well as then how to apply it to a specific subnet. So, let’s jump into the Azure portal. Okay, here we are at the entrance to the Azure portal. And the first thing that I want to show you is what I have in my resource group. So, we have the vnet that we created specifically for applying service endpoints, and we showed that a couple of videos ago. I also have two storage accounts here in the same region. One called storagepoliciesyes, one called storagepoliciesno. Obviously, allowing me to show you very easily which one is going to be allowed and which one is not. </p>
<p>Now in order to enforce that though, we need to create the service endpoint policy. So, we’re going to do that by just clicking on ‘Create’, and the easiest way to do this is just type ‘policy’ inside of the search bar. And then right here at the bottom is service endpoint policy. We’ll go ahead and click ‘Create’. Now, this is pretty straightforward. There is really only two screens that we need to worry about. This first one, specifying our resource group, giving the policy a name. Obviously, we want to go ahead and keep it in the same region as everything else. And then we’re going to define the definition. Now, the definition is very simple and straightforward. All we do is we choose a set of resources. </p>
<p>So, we click on the ‘Add a resource’ button, we get this blade that pops up. And you’ll see here that right now, Microsoft storage is really the only option for us. I presume that over time Microsoft will add additional service endpoint services to this list so that you can do the same thing. But then we pick a scope. Do we want to choose individual storage accounts? Do we want to choose all accounts in a particular resource group, or all accounts in the subscription? And that’s going to be very dependent upon how you have set up your resources in your own subscriptions, how you’ve done your resource organization and management. </p>
<p>In this case, I’m just going to choose ‘Single account’. We’re then going to choose the resource group that the storage account is in. Now, it just so happens it’s in the same one. And then, we’re going to pick the individual storage account. And in this case, you’re always choosing storage accounts that are being allowed. So, I want to choose ‘storagepoliciesyes’. Right, go ahead and click ‘Add’. We now have it here listed under our individual resources. We can also add an alias for specific types of services to be allowed as well. But we’re not going to be focusing on any of that in this particular course. We’re just going to focus on allowing individual storage accounts. </p>
<p>Now, as I said, could have very easily added a couple of storage accounts in a separate resource group and done that as well. But just to show how this is done, we’ll go ahead and click ‘Tags’, we go ahead and click ‘Review + create’. I wonder, do I want to populate here? For this policy to take effect, you will need to associate it to one or more subnets that have virtual network service endpoints. Please visit a virtual network in East US 2 and then select the subnets to which you would like to associate this policy. So, that is still a secondary step. Just the creation of the policy is not enough. So, let’s go ahead and click ‘Create’. And then once this is done, we will go into the virtual network and apply this to the subnet. </p>
<p>And we’re good. All right, let’s go back and we’re going to go directly into the virtual network. We’re going to go into the subnets and choose ‘subnetendpoints’, which is the one that we used in the demonstration a couple of videos ago. Now in this particular subnet, we did set up two different service endpoints, both Microsoft keyVault as well as Microsoft storage, but we didn’t apply any policies because we didn’t have any. In this case though, we do now. Let me scroll down just to make this a little bit easier to see. And we’re going to choose ‘storageyes-policy’. All we have to do is click ‘Save’. And it’s that simple. We have a saved subnet with now a both service endpoint applied as well as a policy. </p>
<p>Now obviously, you can be much more granular, much more descriptive if you create your own JSONs, like we saw with the example earlier, and apply your service endpoint policies, create and apply your service endpoint policies via the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. The Azure portal does not always provide everything that you might want to do from a feature and function perspective. </p>
<p>In the next video, we’ll start to take a look at service tags and how they can be leveraged within the scope of your virtual networks, as well as how they can be used with respect to service endpoints.</p>
<h1 id="Configure-Service-Tags"><a href="#Configure-Service-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Configure Service Tags"></a>Configure Service Tags</h1><p>Hi there. In this video, we’re going to talk about something a little bit different but that is directly tied to service endpoints and that is service tags. Now, what exactly are service tags? They are a group of IP addresses and specifically the prefixes for an Azure service. So if you’re using Azure app service, if you’re using Azure storage, if you’re using Azure key vault Microsoft has provided public endpoints. CNAMEs, IP addresses, related to that service within the scope of your region. You deploy the same service in a different region, you’re going to get a completely different set of IP addresses. The service tags correspond to the IP addresses or specifically the ranges the prefixes of those IP addresses that are associated with a specific service in that region. </p>
<p>They replace the service tag itself is basically nothing more than a name that replaces the IP addresses. For security rules in network security groups Azure firewall, they support a regional scope as I just talked about because they correspond to only the IP addresses of the service in that particular region. So there’s going to be a different set of IP addresses behind that service tag for a different region and they can be used in both in inbound and outbound access. They can also now be used in public preview uh for user-defined routes as well. </p>
<p>Now, a quick example and I’ll actually do a quick demonstration of this as well. This is what a service tag would look like within the scope of a network security group and its corresponding rules. If you’ll see here in the image on the right-hand side. There are two allow rules and a deny rule. The deny rule is the standard one that you find in every network security group but the top two allow for traffic from a virtual network IP address. Hence the virtual network service tag to a storage as well as sequel in East Us, both storage and sequel East Us our service tags that correspond to those respective services. Virtual network also corresponds to a service tag within the scope of your specific subscription. Now let me jump over into the Azure portal. </p>
<p>We’ll quickly just so that we can actually see this live here. We are in the Azure portal. I already have a network security group created and this is just a Default one. I have also already applied this to the subnet that we created in the previous videos that has storage and key vault as valid service endpoints. So what I’m going to do is I’m gonna create an outbound rule for the virtual network to allow for traffic to go from any IP address in the virtual network into that particular storage class. So what I will do is go to outbound security rules. I will click add the source is going to be a service tag and it’s going to be specifically the virtual network. So I’m using the service tag in my source field. </p>
<p>I’m gonna leave sore sport ranges as an asterisk and that’s something I typically do anyway. The destination then will also be a service tag and in this case because if you’ll remember we configured storage as one of the service endpoints, I’m gonna choose storage here And I’ll just do a quick search for it there it is. You’ll notice I can either choose storage globally, thereby allowing for access to any storage service or I can focus on just this particular region which is east us two, and then we can specify destiny destination port ranges and the rest of the pieces are tied to a network security group but that’s how you can leverage service tags within the scope of a security rule. And again, these security rules can be applied in a network security group or in Azure firewall and now in public preview, they can also be leveraged inside of user to find routes. So let’s jump back into the powerpoint. </p>
<p>Now there is a very large list of available service tags that are available within the scope of Azure So many that I could not put them on three slides, let alone one. So here is the URL. That I’m gonna be showing you here in a second. I wanted to make sure that you had an opportunity to see this, write it down, go into your own browser yourself. Now let me show you this list. Okay, here we are in this exact documentation page and this is the available service tags listing uh they do support regional scope and can be used in Azure firewall rules as we already talked about. But this is the entire list and it starts from up here at action groups which are tied to Azure alerts in case you’re interested and goes all the way down to virtual network that we just saw me use. But this is the entire list of service tags that Microsoft has made available. These are out of the box. Every customer has them. You don’t have to worry about doing any kind of configuration. </p>
<p>It’s just up to you to use them as you see fit within the scope of your security rules. Now, one additional feature of service tags is that you can actually use them in your on-premise environments. If you have a hybrid network set up where you are using say express route, for example, to take advantage of access to Azure past services and you want to make sure that no other traffic is flowing out to as you’re you only want traffic to flow to those specific services. You can lever leverage service tags in your on-prem environments as well. They can The service tag information can be used in your on-premise firewalls, for example, the service tag information that you’re going to be gathering is going to be a current point in time list of IP ranges. That list can change over time. So you’re probably gonna want to create an automated process to keep your data up to date based on the information that I found in the documentation. </p>
<p>It can be updated on average once an hour. The data for the service tags, in other words, the IP address listings can be obtained programmatically or via adjacent download the arrest APIs. Power shell and Azure cli here is a quick example using Azure power shell to get the network service tags from a specific region in this case East us two we store the data into the service tags. Then we want to get out just the information related to storage because getting all of the service tag information we just saw that’s going to be a very very large list. But if you’re only worried about controlling traffic to a specific service, you only really need the information for that service. </p>
<p>In this case, it’s going to be storage and then we’re going to be able to get the address prefixes and use that data within the scope of any particular firewall device that you might happen to have. Now there are some gotchas here that you need to be aware of. It can take up to four weeks for new service tag data to propagate within the api results across all Azure regions. Something to keep in mind again based on what we just saw, you’re probably going to want to keep an automated process in place so that you can make sure that the data in your firewalls are always up to date. And most firewalls do have some kind of shell scripting capability, python scripting capability for you to be able to do that, you must be authenticated and have a role with re permissions within the scope of your current subscription to be able to get this data. </p>
<p>So you saw that Azure power shellcode, you did not see the login command that was run first in order to actually authenticate against a specific Azure subscription. The API data represents the tags that can be used with NSG rules which represents a subset of the tags currently in the downloadable Jason file. One of the things to keep in mind is there are service tags that are outside of the scope of security rules that can be leveraged in other places or that Microsoft themselves use internally the Jason file contains everything. </p>
<p>Whereas the programmatic Azure power shell, Azure cli and rest APIs only propagate the ones that are relevant to security rules and that’s really all that there is for service tags I say, all that there is service tags themselves are a very very small feature but the amount of data that’s available and the use of that data for you as a customer is extremely large, you can use it all across the networking inside of Azure and as we’ve now just seen, we can use it outside of Azure in your on Prem environments as well. </p>
<p>In the next video, we’re going to take a look at how to configure access to your service endpoints so that we can actually lock things down and validate that people have the correct access.</p>
<h1 id="Configure-Access-to-Service-Endpoints"><a href="#Configure-Access-to-Service-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Configure Access to Service Endpoints"></a>Configure Access to Service Endpoints</h1><p>Hi there. In this last video, we’re going to focus on how to access the services that are sitting behind a specific service endpoint. Now, it was kind of hard for me to not touch on this during the previous videos, but we’re actually going to focus on just that particular topic. When limiting access there’s a number of different ways that it can be done. Let’s talk first about how to use the service tags. We touched on it a little bit, but within the scope of a network security group or an Azure Firewall, you can actually use service tags to either allow or deny access to specific Azure past services within the scope of your particular subnet that the NSG has been applied to or even all the way down to a specific NIC card. You can use current point-in-time list of IP ranges that those service tags are associated with in your on-prem environment as well, and therefore use them in your own on-prem firewall rules such as the Cisco device, Barracuda, or so on.</p>
<p>You can leverage service endpoint policies which granted, right now, are storage account only, but they do provide the ability for you to limit access to specific storage accounts based off of individual names, resource groups, or subscription IDs. And then there are also specific path services that are associated with service endpoints that have their own access control list features. A couple of examples are storage accounts have additional control list actions such as shared access signatures, where you can actually define the availability of the data within the scope of a storage account container. For example, you can control it based off of incoming IP addresses, you can specify time windows, things along those lines. There’s also the ability to control access to storage accounts via role-based access control inside of Azure, there’s a number of different features related to storage accounts that are inherent to the storage accounts themselves. And then within the scope of key vault, for example, Key Vault has its own firewall as well as access policies, thereby allowing you to limit access to not just Key Vault itself but also to what data is inside of Key Vault.</p>
<p>And one of the things that you’re going to find from a limiting access perspective is that Microsoft has provided an additional capability within the scope of any service that is data-oriented. Key Vault, storage accounts both store data, the database is all stored data. So, they all have additional access capabilities within those services to make sure that data is secured and the customer is happy with that security. Now, just as a quick example, we touched on it a little bit during the last video of service tags, but let’s actually create a deny rule inside of a network security group and deny access to a specific past service that a service endpoint has been set up for. We are back in the portal and we have gone directly into the network security group that I created called endpoints. And what we’re going to do is we’re going to create a quick deny rule that will prevent access to any storage account within a specific region. And then we’re going to apply that network security group to the subnet that we created the service endpoints for.</p>
<p>So, we go into inbound rules, and we create a new one. We want the Source to be anything because we want to block all traffic. The Destination on the other hand is going to be a specific ‘Service Tag’ and we are going to, remember we actually turned on both Key Vault and storage accounts. So, let’s lockdown storage accounts that exist inside of GermanyNorth. We are going to deny all traffic to all storage accounts that sit inside of the GermanyNorth region. And in this case, we’re going to, Destination ports ranges will be all, Protocol, ‘Any’. We’re going to do a ‘Deny’. The priority number just needs to be higher than 65,500 so that it will take effect first. And then we’re just going to give it a name, and we’re done. Now, before this can actually work and prevent traffic from flowing into a storage account that sits in GermanyNorth, we have to apply it to the subnet.</p>
<p>So, let’s go back to our resource group and specifically the vnet. And go to the ‘Subnets’ and go to the subnet endpoints. We’re going to make sure that the network security group that we just modified has been applied to this subnet. So, in this instance now, we actually have dual layers of accessibility to storage accounts within the scope of this subnet. We turned on Microsoft.Storage as a service endpoint. However, we have a network security group that’s blocking all traffic to storage accounts in GermanyNorth. And of course, we could add additional rules if we wanted to limit it even further. But then we also have a storage account endpoint policy that is also allowing two specific storage accounts. So, it allows you to create that multilayered approach of accessibility from a security perspective with respect to service endpoints. And of course, this can be leveraged here in network security groups. </p>
<p>We can also create deny rules or allow rules inside of the Azure Firewall as well. And then as I mentioned, there are a number of other capabilities, especially within storage accounts that you can take advantage of to even layer your security or your accessibility to the data within those storage accounts even further. That’s going to do it for this course. I hope that you’ve enjoyed all of the content. We’ll wrap things up in a conclusion video next.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Hi there and welcome back. I just want to do a quick wrap-up of what we covered here in this course by looking at the objectives that we talked about at the very beginning. We looked at how to create service endpoints, what are service endpoints, and then how to actually configure endpoint policies for things like storage accounts, whereby allowing you to limit which storage accounts are actually going to be accessible through the service endpoints? We talked about how to configure service tags and actually leverage those service tags throughout numerous areas of your networking architecture. </p>
<p>And then we talked even more thoroughly about how to configure access to service endpoints using both service tags as well as other mechanisms that are available inside of your Azure networking. As well as even touched on some of the additional features that the past services provide for themselves to limit access. </p>
<p>So, with that I hope that you’ve enjoyed this particular content and that you’ve enjoyed the course. If you are looking for any other Azure topics, Cloud Academy has an entire Azure training library that you can take advantage of. And if you happen to be interested, I’ve created a number of additional courses as well. So, I hope that you’ve enjoyed it, and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
