        <h1 id="Compute"><a href="#Compute" class="headerlink" title="Compute"></a>Compute</h1><span id="more"></span>

<p>Compute services are services used for running code.  So, maybe you have purchased some software and you need the hardware to run it.  Or maybe you are developing your own custom software and need machines to build and test it.  Any project that requires processing power and memory can take advantage of a Compute service.</p>
<p>When most people think about Cloud computing, they immediately think of virtual machines.  You can configure virtual machines to do pretty much anything you want.  Google’s main service for creating your own VMs is called Compute Engine.  Compute Engine VMs can either run Linux or Windows.  And there are many different predefined machine types to choose from, each with different amounts of processing power and memory.  General-purpose machines offer the best price-performance ratio.  While optimized machines offer higher levels of performance for either compute, memory or graphics.  You can also create custom machine types as well.</p>
<h2 id="Compute-Engine"><a href="#Compute-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Compute Engine"></a>Compute Engine</h2><p>Compute Engine is “Infrastructure-as-a-Service”.  That means you can use it to build pretty much whatever you want.  You can spin up a powerful Windows instance and install SQL Server.  Or you can spin up a smaller Linux instance and install Apache web server.  The possibilities are near endless.</p>
<p>So that’s great if you want to build everything from scratch, but what if you want to move over some existing infrastructure?  Luckily, Google has made it easy to migrate.  If you are currently using VMware, then you can use <strong>Google Cloud VMware Engine</strong> to run any existing VMs.  Now if you are running bare metal servers or have another type of VM, then you can migrate those over to Compute Engine using Migrate for Compute Engine.  This service makes it really fast and easy to move your workloads over.  It creates a new instance on GCP while copying the data from your original VM.  Once the data transfer is finished, the GCP instance reboots, and then your migration is complete.  In addition to VMware and physical machines, Migrate for Compute Engine can also support VMs running on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h2 id="Google-Kubernetes-Engine"><a href="#Google-Kubernetes-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Google Kubernetes Engine"></a>Google Kubernetes Engine</h2><p>Virtual machines are not the only compute resource.  These days, <strong>containers</strong> have become increasingly popular.  Containers are somewhat like virtual machines, except they don’t include the operating system.  This means that they lose a little bit of flexibility, but the upside is that containers are much more lightweight.  They take up less disk space and they are faster to start up and shut down.</p>
<p><strong>Google Kubernetes Engine</strong> (or GKE) is used for running containers on Google.  It makes it easy to deploy, maintain and scale your containerized applications.  It also includes features for logging, monitoring, and health management.  Now, <font color="orange">some people want to spread out their containers to run across multiple cloud providers</font>.  And Google has created a product just for this.  This is called <font color="pink"><strong>Anthos</strong></font>.  With Anthos, you can run many different containers across multiple locations.  So you could have some running on-premises, some on GCP, and some on AWS.   Anthos provides a single command interface that controls and monitors everything.  So if you are building a hybrid environment, you might want to check Anthos out. </p>
<h2 id="Anthos"><a href="#Anthos" class="headerlink" title="Anthos"></a>Anthos</h2><p>If you are interested in converting some of your VMs to containers. Google makes this easy with Migrate for Anthos.  Just pick a VM and it will be transformed into a GKE container.  You can also combine Migrate for Compute Engine with Migrate for Anthos to convert a physical server to a container, if you wish.</p>
<p>While Compute Engine (CE) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) give you a lot of power, they do require quite a lot of work.  You have to provision instances.  You have to be able to pick the right machine types.  You have to apply the latest patches and security updates.  If you already know how to do all this, then it is probably not a big deal.  But a lot of times customers don’t know and don’t care about this level of detail.  This is where Google’s “serverless” options come in.  </p>
<h2 id="App-Engine"><a href="#App-Engine" class="headerlink" title="App Engine"></a>App Engine</h2><p>Google has a “Platform-as-a-Service” offering called App Engine.  App Engine lets you run web and mobile applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.  You just upload your code and let GCP take care of the rest.  It will provision and scale the underlying resources up and down automatically.  When there is little to no traffic, App Engine will scale down so that you are charged less.  When your app starts receiving lots of traffic, it will scale up to handle the load.  Compute Engine gives you far more control and flexibility.  But App Engine provides simplicity and ease-of-use.</p>
<h2 id="Cloud-Run"><a href="#Cloud-Run" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Run"></a>Cloud Run</h2><p>Similarly, Google has a serverless offering for containers, called Cloud Run.  If you have a complex application that involves many different containers, then you’ll probably want to stick with using GKE.  But if your application runs inside a single container, then Cloud Run is much easier to use.   Just upload your container and let Cloud Run deploy it as a stateless, auto scaling service.</p>
<h2 id="Cloud-Functions"><a href="#Cloud-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Functions"></a>Cloud Functions</h2><p>So App Engine is for running applications and Cloud Run is for running containers.  But what if you just want to call a simple function?  Well, there is a third serverless option for that as well.  <font color="orange">Cloud Functions can create small, single-purpose functions that respond to events.</font>  For example, you could configure a Cloud Function to be triggered whenever a file is uploaded or whenever a database is changed.  Cloud Functions are great for adding a little extra functionality without having to create something far more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>If you want to run a Windows application, you should pick Compute Engine.<br>If you want to run a Java or Python app, then App Engine would probably be the best choice.<br>For running a single container, I would choose Cloud Run.<br>For a multiple container application, then you probably want to choose GKE.<br>Unless you also want to distribute your containers across multiple cloud vendors, then you would pick Anthos.<br>And if you just want to run a simple function whenever an event occurs, Cloud Functions would be the right tool.</p>
<h1 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h1><p>Storage services are all about storing data.  Different types of data require different types of services.  For example, data can be divided into two main types: structured and unstructured.  Structured data is composed of clearly defined data types and patterns.  Think of stuff like names, dates and credit card numbers.  Structured data is easy to search and usually is kept in a relational database.  Unstructured data is just the opposite.  It is more freeform and has no obvious organization.  So think about things like music, photos and video.</p>
<p>When most people think of storage, they probably think of files in a filesystem.  This would be an excellent example of unstructured data.  If you want to read and write files to the cloud, then you can use Google Cloud Storage.  Cloud Storage is perfect for serving web pages, archiving log files, or you can even use it as a data lake.  A data lake is basically a repository of raw data that can be used for later analysis or machine learning.  Essentially, it is just a really big collection of unorganized data.</p>
<p>Cloud Storage is fast, secure, durable, and has almost unlimited capacity.  Because there are different types of unstructured data, Cloud Storage offers several different storage classes:</p>
<h2 id="Standard-Storage"><a href="#Standard-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Standard Storage"></a>Standard Storage</h2><p>Standard storage is best for short-lived or frequently accessed data.  This class costs the most, but there is no minimum for length of storage.</p>
<h2 id="Nearline-Storage"><a href="#Nearline-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Nearline Storage"></a>Nearline Storage</h2><p>Nearline storage is best when you need to store things for a longer period of time (at least 30-days) and need to access it less frequently (eg: once per month or less).  Files stored in nearline will cost less than standard.</p>
<h2 id="Coldline-storage"><a href="#Coldline-storage" class="headerlink" title="Coldline storage"></a>Coldline storage</h2><p>Coldline storage is even cheaper, but it has a longer storage minimum (90 days) and should only be used for files you need to access four times a year or less.</p>
<h2 id="Archive-Storage"><a href="#Archive-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Archive Storage"></a>Archive Storage</h2><p>Archive storage is the cheapest.  This is the best choice when you need to keep files for a long time due to compliance.  Archive storage must be kept for at least 365 days, and it should only be accessed less than once a year.<br>All four storage classes give you immediate access to your files. This is different from some other cloud providers, where the lowest cost storage can take hours to access.</p>
<p>Now while it stores files, Cloud Storage does not work exactly like a traditional file system.  It is considered <strong>“object storage”</strong>.  So there are no actual directories, and everything is kept inside “buckets”.  You also cannot edit or update part of a file.  You can only delete and recreate it.  If you need “block level” storage access with a true hierarchical structure, you can use Filestore instead.   </p>
<h2 id="Filestore"><a href="#Filestore" class="headerlink" title="Filestore"></a>Filestore</h2><p>Filestore can be used to create NFS-compatible file shares that can be mounted on your virtual machines and containers.  If you just want to store and share files, Cloud Storage is perfect.  But if you need lower level block access or say you need to constantly append data to the end of a file, Firestore is a much better match.</p>
<h2 id="Cloud-SQL"><a href="#Cloud-SQL" class="headerlink" title="Cloud SQL"></a>Cloud SQL</h2><p>Now these options are fine if you just want to store your data in files.  But what about databases?  Well Google has several services for those too.  If you want to store structured data inside organized tables, columns and rows (much like a traditional SQL database) then Cloud SQL could be a good choice.  It is fully-managed by Google, so it is very easy to get started.  And it supports the most common database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.  So if you are already using one of those, you can easily migrate to Cloud SQL and then let Google manage the details for you.  Cloud SQL is perfect for storing data you need to sort, transform, and search.</p>
<h2 id="Cloud-Spanner"><a href="#Cloud-Spanner" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Spanner"></a>Cloud Spanner</h2><p>If for some reason Cloud SQL isn’t powerful enough, then Google offers something even better: Cloud Spanner.  Cloud Spanner is unique because it is a relational database that’s massively scalable. You can get much higher performance than Cloud SQL, however it comes with a higher cost.  Cloud Spanner is for companies that need an extremely powerful, multi-regional database that can handle a heavy amount of I&#x2F;O.</p>
<h2 id="Big-Data"><a href="#Big-Data" class="headerlink" title="Big Data"></a>Big Data</h2><p>Finally, if you need to store and work with structured “Big Data” (which is extremely large and complex data sets) then BigQuery might be your best bet.  BigQuery is Google’s data warehouse service.  Now, a data warehouse stores data from multiple sources, including data lakes and databases, and can be used to analyze huge, multidimensional datasets.  Databases are optimized for transactions.  But data warehouses are optimized for analytics.  BigQuery can process petabytes of data and it integrates with many other services.  For example, Looker (a business intelligence solution) works with BigQuery to help you explore your data and share insights in real time.</p>
<p>Of course, Google also supports non-relational or <font color="red"><strong>“NoSQL”</strong> </font>databases as well.  NoSQL databases do not use tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize data and are particularly useful for storing unstructured data.  NoSQL supports flexible data models, it scales horizontally, and it has incredibly fast queries.  However, searching, sorting and joining data is much more limited.</p>
<p>There are three main options here, and they include:</p>
<h2 id="Firestore"><a href="#Firestore" class="headerlink" title="Firestore"></a>Firestore</h2><p>Firestore, which is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications<br>Firebase, which is best for syncing data between users in real-time, such as in collaboration apps</p>
<h2 id="Bigtable"><a href="#Bigtable" class="headerlink" title="Bigtable"></a>Bigtable</h2><p>Bigtable, which is best for running large analytical workloads</p>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>If you need to store files for sharing, then Cloud Storage will probably be your best option.</p>
<p>If you need to edit and update files, then you might want to look at using Filestore. </p>
<p>For SQL databases you have three main choices:</p>
<p>Cloud SQL is great for when you need a standard MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server</p>
<p>Cloud Spanner will handle larger workloads that Cloud SQL can’t</p>
<p>Big Query is great for creating a data warehouse for analytics</p>
<p>You also have three choices when it comes to noSQL databases as well:</p>
<p>Firestore is great for smaller applications (such as web and mobile)</p>
<p>Firebase is better for larger datasets</p>
<p>Bigtable is best for running very large analytical workloads</p>
<p>That should cover the main storage offerings on GCP. </p>
<h1 id="Network"><a href="#Network" class="headerlink" title="Network"></a>Network</h1><p>Google networking services are focused on allowing your other resources to connect and communicate.  Your Compute and Storage resources can be as accessible or isolated as you need.  You can reroute traffic when a VMs fails.  Or throttle high traffic so that a database is not overwhelmed.  Also, networking services include setting policies and rules that ensure that only authorized connections are allowed.</p>
<h2 id="VPC"><a href="#VPC" class="headerlink" title="VPC"></a>VPC</h2><p>Virtual Private Clouds (or VPC for short) allow you to organize and share your resources.  VPCs are networks that are logically isolated from each other.  VPCs can be used to group or separate VMs and containers.  You can also divide a VPC into sub-networks, define routes, and specify how traffic should flow between them.</p>
<p>By default, all incoming traffic to a VPC is blocked, and all outgoing traffic is allowed.  This protects your VPC from outside access, but allows your resources to still connect to the internet.  By creating firewall rules, you have the ability to override this default behavior.  So you can block outbound traffic in case you want to prevent a resource from accessing the internet.  Or you can allow external access to a public web server.  You can also control which VPCs can connect to each other using a service called VPC Network Peering.</p>
<h2 id="Cloud-VPN"><a href="#Cloud-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Cloud VPN"></a>Cloud VPN</h2><p>Now, what if you want to connect a VPC to an external network outside of Google?  For example, maybe you wish to route traffic between your own private data centers.  There are several ways of accomplishing this.  First, you can create a secure connection to a VPC using Cloud VPN.  VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.  A VPN uses the public internet to send encrypted traffic back and forth.  This works, but it does mean that any slowdown or disruption of the internet can affect your internal connections as well.  </p>
<h2 id="Cloud-Interconnect"><a href="#Cloud-Interconnect" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Interconnect"></a>Cloud Interconnect</h2><p>So, if you want even greater security and reliability, you can use Cloud Interconnect instead.  Cloud Interconnect is much more expensive than a VPN, but it provides a direct, dedicated connection to Google which results in higher speed and reliability.  Now as a third option, you can also choose Direct Peering by coordinating with your local internet service provider.  Peering is free, but it depends on your ISP.  It’s not really well-integrated with GCP and requires a lot more setup.</p>
<h2 id="Load-Balancers"><a href="#Load-Balancers" class="headerlink" title="Load Balancers"></a>Load Balancers</h2><p>Google has many other networking services as well.  For example, Load Balancers help distribute network traffic among groups of resources, so that no individual part of your infrastructure gets overwhelmed.  </p>
<h2 id="Cloud-Armor"><a href="#Cloud-Armor" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Armor"></a>Cloud Armor</h2><p>Cloud Armor works with your load balancers to provide built-in defenses against application and Denial of Service attacks.  </p>
<h2 id="Cloud-DNS"><a href="#Cloud-DNS" class="headerlink" title="Cloud DNS"></a>Cloud DNS</h2><p>Cloud DNS allows you to create and manage millions of DNS records, for both public and private domains.  </p>

<h1 id="Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"></a>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h1><p>Google is known for being on the cutting edge of this space.  The world was shocked when its AlphaGo software defeated one of the best human players of the board game, Go.</p>
<p>For those who don’t already know, Artificial intelligence (usually abbreviated as AI) is a field of study that attempts to give machines the same level of intelligence that humans possess.  Essentially, <font color="orange">the goal of AI is to create machines that are capable of acting on their own, without direct human intervention.</font>  Now AI is sort of a wider field of study, where Machine Learning (or ML) is a specific branch in that field.  Machine learning is mostly focused on developing systems that can learn.  Now by “learn”, I mean that they use large amounts of data to slowly improve their responses.</p>
<p>Currently, Google divides its AI and ML services into four categories: Sight, Language, Conversation, and Structured Data.</p>
<h2 id="Sight"><a href="#Sight" class="headerlink" title="Sight"></a>Sight</h2><p>Under Sight, they have services like the Vision API, which can detect objects, faces, and text in images.  The Video Intelligence API recognizes objects, places, and actions in video.  Document AI uses machine learning to help you parse and identify data inside your documents, such as company names, addresses, and phone numbers.</p>
<h2 id="Language"><a href="#Language" class="headerlink" title="Language"></a>Language</h2><p>Under Language, they have the Translation API, which can convert text from one language to another.  It currently supports over one hundred different languages.  They also have the Natural Language API, which performs tasks like sentiment analysis.  For example, it can classify a message as being either positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
<h2 id="Conversation"><a href="#Conversation" class="headerlink" title="Conversation"></a>Conversation</h2><p>The Conversation category includes the Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs, which do exactly what you would expect.  It also includes a service called DialogFlow, which can generate realistic sounding dialogue.  Using DialogFlow, you can build chatbots and voicebots to handle things like customer support requests.</p>
<h2 id="Structured-Data"><a href="#Structured-Data" class="headerlink" title="Structured Data"></a>Structured Data</h2><p>The last category is Structured Data. These services allow you to feed in structured data and get back insights.  For example, the <strong>Recommendations AI</strong> can look at a customer’s previous purchases and recommend other products that they might be interested in buying.  Also, <strong>Cloud Talent</strong> Solutions can automatically detect and understand job content and applicant intent. Candidates can quickly find the most appropriate jobs, while companies can identify, attract and hire quality candidates.</p>
<p>All of these prebuilt AI services have been trained based on general sets of data, so they might not be able to handle your specific needs. Now for these scenarios, Google provides its AutoML suite of services. For example, you might need to identify product defects in your factory assembly lines.  By feeding your own data into AutoML Vision, you can train a custom model without having to know machine learning.</p>
<p>If you need to build custom models that are outside the scope of the AutoML suite, then you can use Vertex AI (which was previously named the AI Platform suite).  It includes many different services, but the most important ones are AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction. The Training service lets you train custom models using popular Python-based frameworks.  Or you can also access a repository of plug-and-play AI components (including end-to-end AI pipelines and out-of-the-box algorithms) by using AI Hub.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-3"><a href="#Summary-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Sight services, including the Vision API, Document API, and Video Intelligence API<br>Language services, including the Translation API and Natural Language API<br>Conversation services, include Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text and DialogFlow<br>Structured Data services, including Recommendations AI and Talent Solutions<br>Now, remember, if the standard APIs are not enough, you can also train your own models using AutoML.  And you can access AI Hub for plug-and-play AI components as well. And that should cover the main AI &amp; ML services on GCP.</p>
<h1 id="Security-and-Operations"><a href="#Security-and-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Security and Operations"></a>Security and Operations</h1><h2 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h2><p>First, let’s talk about security.  Security services exist to help you protect your data.  One of the main concerns with using the cloud is privacy.  You want to be able to control exactly who can access your data.  So privacy is the goal, and security is the method.  Google security services allow you to define policies, procedures, and controls that everyone must follow.  In order to protect your customers and your company, you need to properly implement security.  The policies you define will often be shaped by compliance requirements.  Compliance refers to a third party set of standards, usually by some sort of regulatory authority.  For example, different countries have different laws about storing and encrypting data.  Digital security is complicated, so there are many different GCP services to assist you.</p>
<p><strong>Security Command Center</strong> provides a centralized control panel to help you discover vulnerabilities, detect threats, and generate reports.  <strong>Secret Manager</strong> gives you centralized storage for things like passwords, API keys, and certificates.  The <strong>Data Loss Prevention service</strong> helps you identify and scrub sensitive data. For example, if your user records contain credit card numbers, you could configure DLP to remove them before responding to a database query.</p>
<h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>Next, I want to talk about operation services.  Now operations is focused on monitoring and maintaining your existing infrastructure. </p>
<p>So you have things like Google Cloud Operations Suite which was previously called Stackdriver.  Now this suite includes:</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Logging</strong>: This acts as a centralized repository for all your logs.  It makes it easy to find your logs and to search the entries for any messages you are interested in.<br><strong>Cloud Monitoring</strong>: This gives you an overview of everything that is happening.  You can view metrics like CPU utilization, response latency, and network traffic.  Plus, you can use it to set up alerts to notify you where there are any problems.  If a metric is too low or too high, you will know about it right away.<br><strong>Cloud Debugger</strong>: This helps you easily track down software bugs by allowing you to inspect the state of a running application.<br><strong>Cloud Profiler</strong>: This can be used to identify <strong>latency issues</strong> inside of an application.<br><strong>Cloud Trace</strong>: This helps you track down <strong>latency issues</strong> that exist between two or more applications.<br>Now there are other operation tools as well.  These include things like:</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Deployment Manager</strong> which allows you to write templates and then use those to provision resources.  You can have a template for creating a VM, and then run it 20 times to get 20 VMs.  This is extremely useful for when you need to create a lot of the same resources.  Now you no longer have to create everything by hand.<br><strong><font color="pink">Cloud Build</font></strong> is a tool that can help automate building, testing and deploying your code.<br><strong>Apigee</strong> helps you design secure and scale application programming interfaces (or APIs).  This way your web services can easily communicate with each other.<br><strong>Cloud Composer</strong> can be used to create, schedule, monitor, and manage workflows that span across clouds and on-premises data centers.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-4"><a href="#Summary-4" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Under Security, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Security Command Center provides a centralized overview of security issues</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secret Manager for storing passwords and keys</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data Loss Prevention for identifying and hiding sensitive data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Operations, we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cloud Operations Suite</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Includes Logging &amp; Monitoring</p>
</li>
<li><p>Debugging for finding bugs in an app</p>
</li>
<li><p>Profiling for identifying slowdowns in an app</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trace for identifying bottlenecks between applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment Manager for creating templates and automating infrastructure changes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Build for automating software deployments</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apigee for building APIs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Composer for managing workflows</p>
</li>
</ul>
