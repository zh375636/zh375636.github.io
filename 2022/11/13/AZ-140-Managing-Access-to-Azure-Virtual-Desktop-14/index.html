<h1 id="Planning-and-Implementing-Azure-Roles-and-Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-for-Azure-Virtual-Desktop"><a href="#Planning-and-Implementing-Azure-Roles-and-Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-for-Azure-Virtual-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Planning and Implementing Azure Roles and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Azure Virtual Desktop"></a>Planning and Implementing Azure Roles and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Azure Virtual Desktop</h1><p>Welcome to this module on Planning and Implementing Azure Roles and Role-Based Access Control or RBAC for Azure Virtual Desktop. In this module, we’ll cover the following topics, what is role-based access control or RBAC? We’ll discuss some of the Azure Virtual Desktop specific built-in roles. Finally, we’ll talk about delegated access in Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p>Let’s start by discussing what role-based access control, better known as RBAC, is. It allows you to manage who has access to resources within Azure. It is an authorization mechanism that is built on Azure Resource Manager, better known as ARM, that allows administrators to configure fine-grained access management to resources.</p>
<p>There are three elements to role-based access control. The first is a security principle, which represents some type of object, for example, a user or a group. The second type of element, is role definition, which is a collection or a set of permissions. Essentially a role definition lists the actions. For example, read, write or delete, that can be performed. The final element is a scope. This is a set of resources to which the access is applying to. There are different levels of scope, including management groups, subscriptions and resource groups.</p>
<p>In the next part of this course, we are going to look at some of the built-in roles that are relevant to Azure Virtual Desktop. We start off with desktop virtualization role, which has a reader role and a contributor role. The reader role allows you to view all aspects of the deployment, but not make any changes. The contributor role enables you to manage all parts of the deployment, however, it does not allow you to access to any of the compute resources.</p>
<p>The next relevant role is the desktop virtualization host pool role, which again, has a reader and contributor level access. The reader level allows you to view all aspects of the host pool only and not modify any settings, whereas a contributor role allows you to manage everything within the host pool. However, you do need an additional contributor role for the virtual machine, if you wish to create any VMs. The desktop application group role, is similar to the host pool role, in that it has both reader and contributor levels. With the reader level role, it allows you to view everything within the application group and the contributor level, allow you to manage everything within the application groups. However, if you wish to publish apps, you need to have the user access administrator role.</p>
<p>Next, we have the desktop virtualization workspace role, which again has two levels, reader and contributor. The reader level role allows you to view all aspects of the workspace but not adding anything. The contributor level role allows you to manage everything within the workspace. However, to obtain information on applications within that app group, you need to be assigned the application group reader role. There are two more roles that are relevant to Azure Virtual Desktop. The first is the desktop virtualization user session operator. This role allows you to manage user logins and to do tasks such as sending messages, disconnecting sessions, and remotely logging users off by sessions.</p>
<p>The final role is called desktop virtualization session host operator. This role will enable you to change drain mode and view and remove session hosts from a host pool. This level of access does not have right permissions, however, so you cannot add session host into the host pool. In the final section of this module, we are going to view delegated access with Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p>Like role-based access control, delegated access has the same three elements, which are security principles, role definitions, and scope. Security principles have three values, which are all objects, including users, groups, and service principles. Role definitions have two type of roles. Either built-in roles, which we discussed in the previous section of this module and custom roles. These are roles you can customize with different permissions. Finally, we have the scope elements of delegated access. As mentioned earlier, this is the resources you assign the roles and permissions to, which include host pools, app groups, and workspaces.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Roles-Groups-and-Rights-Assignment-on-Azure-Virtual-Desktop-Session-Hosts"><a href="#Managing-Roles-Groups-and-Rights-Assignment-on-Azure-Virtual-Desktop-Session-Hosts" class="headerlink" title="Managing Roles, Groups, and Rights Assignment on Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts"></a>Managing Roles, Groups, and Rights Assignment on Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts</h1><p>Welcome to this module on managing roles, groups, and rights assignment on Azure Virtual Desktop. In this module, we’ll cover the following topics, which will both be demo-focused. We will look at how to add users to the Azure Virtual Desktop-specific roles. Finally, we’ll walk through how to add users and groups to Azure Virtual Desktop host pools, to allow access to session hosts.</p>
<p>In this first section, we are going to show how to add users to the Azure Virtual desktop specific groups we have discussed in the planning and implementing Azure roles and role-based access control, RBAC, for Azure Virtual Desktop module. Here we are in the Azure portal. We first need to navigate to the Azure Virtual Desktop service. We have two options, we can either user search at the top, where we can type Azure Virtual Desktop, like this, and click on the service. Or, like me, if you have it as a shortcut on the dashboard, you can just click this, and it’ll take you to the service as well.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll click on Host pools in the left-hand pane. Now we can see our host pools in the center. In this case, we have a single host pool, click on the host pool, and we now see the overview for this resource. On the left-hand pane, we need to look for access control, IAM, to the access control service for this host pool.</p>
<p>Now we want to try and add a user to one of the desktop virtualization role assignments we discussed in an earlier module, so we will select Add, and then Add role assignment. We are now on the Add role assignment menu, and we can see all the available roles here, including the desktop virtualization roles. Let’s select one at random. Let’s say, the host pool reader role, then click on Next. We now have the option of either adding users, groups, or service principle to this role, or we can add a managed identity. In our case, we want to add a user, so we’ll click on Select members and add our user. We then click on the Review and assign button, and the same again. We can now see the desktop virtualization host pool reader role has appeared with a user we added.</p>
<p>This user now has read-only access to all the host pool resources. In this section, we are going to look at how we add a group to the host pool assignment, which will allow them access to log into the relevant session hosts. We first need to make sure we have created a security group, either on on-premises active directory, that I synchronized with Azure AD, or a cloud-based security group in Azure AD In our example, we have created a cloud security group in Azure AD, called AVD Users. We need to browse to the Azure Virtual Desktop service, as we did previously.</p>
<p>From here, we select the Application group. On the left-hand pane of our application group, we’ll navigate down to Assignments, where we can now click on Add. We now find the security group called AVD Users and select this. You should know that you can assign users to the application group directly, as well. However, it is a best practice recommendation to your security groups, as it is a less administrative overhead.</p>
<h1 id="Configuring-User-Restrictions-by-Using-AD-Group-Policies-and-Azure-Policies"><a href="#Configuring-User-Restrictions-by-Using-AD-Group-Policies-and-Azure-Policies" class="headerlink" title="Configuring User Restrictions by Using AD Group Policies and Azure Policies"></a>Configuring User Restrictions by Using AD Group Policies and Azure Policies</h1><p>Welcome to this module on configuring user restrictions by using AD group policies and Azure policies. In this module, we’ll cover the following topics: We’ll discuss how to manage Azure Virtual Desktop with Group Policy. Finally, we’ll take a look at the features available when managing Azure Virtual Desktop with Endpoint Manager.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at managing Azure Virtual Desktop with Group Policy. The policies available depend on what domain the session hosts are joined to. You can join session hosts to either Active Directory or Azure Active Directory Domain services. Both allow you to use the Group policy management tool to manage the various policies. If you use Azure AD Domain Services, you need to ensure your administrator account is a member of the Azure AD DC administrators group.</p>
<p>If the session hosts are joined to an Azure AD Domain Services tenant, you have two main policies called AADDC Computers and AADDC Users which you can edit and use to manage the Azure Virtual Desktop environment. If the session hosts are joined to an Active Directory Domain, either on-premises or a VM in Azure, then you can utilize all the standard GPOs that are available with a Domain Controller to manage the Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Let’s now move on to discussing managing Azure Virtual Desktop with Endpoint Manager.</p>
<p>Session hosts need to not only be domain joined but also enrolled into Intune to enable management, which is better known as Hybrid join. Once your session hosts are hybrid joined, you can start to manage them and take advantage of Endpoint Management features, such as compliance policies, which allow you to set baseline compliance the sessions hosts must meet. Configuration profiles, which allow you to configure settings including control panel access and desktop background on the session hosts. You can also utilize Windows Update for Business to manage update patching on the session hosts.</p>
<p>Finally, you can deploy applications to the session hosts including Office, other Win32 apps, and also, apps via the Windows Store.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>In this short module, we covered two main areas around management of Azure Virtual Desktop environment. First, we discussed managing Azure Virtual Desktop with Group Policy, and depending on how the session hosts are domain joined, you have different options. You can either use the limited policies available where the session hosts are joined to an Azure AD Domain Services tenant, or you can use the traditional more granular policies that are available when the session hosts are joined to an active directory domain.</p>
<p>In the final part of the module, we discussed how to manage Azure Virtual Desktop with Endpoint Manager. We discussed the requirement to hybrid join the session hosts, which then opened up the many features of Endpoint Manager, including compliance policies to set compliance policy baselines on the session host, configuration profiles to control settings on Windows 10, including control panel access and desktop background to name a few. You can then manage session host updates and patching via the Windows Update for Business service and to ensure that OS stays secure. Finally, you can deploy applications, including Office suite Win32 apps and apps from the Windows store.</p>
