<h1 id="Planning-and-Implementing-Conditional-Access-Policies-for-Connections-to-Azure-Virtual-Desktop"><a href="#Planning-and-Implementing-Conditional-Access-Policies-for-Connections-to-Azure-Virtual-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Planning and Implementing Conditional Access Policies for Connections to Azure Virtual Desktop"></a>Planning and Implementing Conditional Access Policies for Connections to Azure Virtual Desktop</h1><p>Welcome to this module on planning and implementing conditional access policies for connections to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-virtual-desktop-architecture-2046/azure-virtual-desktop-overview/">Azure Virtual Desktop</a> based on requirements. In this module, we’ll cover the following topics. What are the requirements to implement conditional access policies with Azure Virtual Desktop? We will then walk-through a demo to create a conditional access policy with session settings.</p>
<p>Let’s start by discussing conditional access policy requirements for Azure Virtual Desktop. We need to ensure that the Microsoft 365 tenant has the relevant licensing which includes the conditional access feature. This is covered by the Azure AD P1 licenses and above. You then need to ensure you have a fully configured Azure Virtual Desktop environment, including a host pool and an application group. We will now complete a walk through demo of creating a conditional access policy with session settings.</p>
<p>As you can see, we are logged into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-identity-management/introduction-to-azure-ad/">Azure Active Directory</a> portal with an account that has Global Admin access. We now navigate to the Security option, and from here Conditional Access. We then select New policy, then create a new policy. Let’s give the policy a name, in our example let’s use AVD MFA. Under the Assignments section you need to select the group you want this policy to apply to. In our example, we are going to use an existing group called AVD-Users.</p>
<p>Moving on we click on Cloud apps or actions, then select apps. On the right-hand side we see a list of applications to choose from. If we start to type in the word Windows, we can now see Azure Virtual Desktop as an option. Click on this and then hit the select button. In our example we are not going to create any conditions, but I quickly want to highlight the types of conditions you are able to set. You can control MFA access to AVD based on the Device platform, for example is it an iOS device? Or you can put a condition based on location, for example you may wish to exempt a local office network from being prompted for MFA.</p>
<p>The other options you see are client apps, device state, or filter for devices. For our demo, we are going to leave all these options not configured and move onto access control. We need to select Grant. Because we want to enforce MFA, we select require <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-microsoft-365-access-and-authentication/manage-user-settings-azure-multi-factor-authentication-cloud/">multi-factor authentication</a>. There are other options as we see here, where a device needs to be marked as compliant, or require that the device be Hybrid joined for example. </p>
<p>Before we are ready to create the policy, we need to configure session control. If we click on this and now we see several options on the right-hand pane. For your example, we want to tick sign-in frequency which allows us to control the amount of time before a user needs to authenticate their MFA. If we look at Units first, we can select hours or days, and then we can enter the numerical value above that. In our example, we are going to configure seven days, but you should configure according to your organization’s policies. Then, we can click on create and ensure the on option is selected. That concludes the demo.</p>
<h1 id="Planning-and-Implementing-Multi-Factor-Authentication-in-Azure-Virtual-Desktop"><a href="#Planning-and-Implementing-Multi-Factor-Authentication-in-Azure-Virtual-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Planning and Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication in Azure Virtual Desktop"></a>Planning and Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication in Azure Virtual Desktop</h1><p>Welcome to this module on planning and implementing multi-factor authentication in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-virtual-desktop-architecture-2046/azure-virtual-desktop-overview/">Azure Virtual Desktop</a>. In this module, we’ll cover the following topics. We’ll look at what is required to integrate Azure Virtual Desktop with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-microsoft-365-access-and-authentication/manage-user-settings-azure-multi-factor-authentication-cloud/">Multi-Factor Authentication</a>, better known as MFA. We will complete this lecture by doing a walk-through demo of how to implement MFA settings.</p>
<p>Let’s initially take a look at some of the requirements to implement multi-factor authentication with AVD. Like most Microsoft 365, services you need to ensure you have the relevant license in place. Now although MFA can be configured with the basic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-identity-management/introduction-to-azure-ad/">Azure AD</a> subscription, this is only with security baselines in place. In order to integrate it with Azure Virtual Desktop, you require a minimum of Azure AD P1. You also need to ensure you have an existing Azure Virtual Desktop environment, including a host pool and application group.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to ensure you have a conditional access policy in place to enable MFA for Azure Virtual Desktop. As we saw in the demo for the last lecture, MFA is configured via a Conditional access policy. We have already seen a demo on how to configure a conditional access policy to enable MFA in the last lecture. In this demo, we are going to look at MFA settings in Azure. Here we are in the Azure AD portal, and we initially want to navigate to security and then MFA.</p>
<p>Here we have a number of options we can configure, including Account lockout, Fraud alerts, and look at activity reports. If we take a closer look at account lockout settings, we can customize three different settings. The number of MFA denials that will trigger an account lockout. The number of minutes until an account lockout counter is reset. And finally, the number of minutes until an account is automatically unlocked. With the fraud alert settings, it is turned off by default, therefore you have the ability to enable this. This will automatically turn on the setting to automatically block users who report fraud.</p>
<p>Finally, you can set a specific code which signifies a fraud report. The default setting is zero. The final setting I mentioned was activity reports, which allow you to review which users have been completing MFA authentication, the time, the app that was being used, as well as the authentication method, among other details. These three settings as well as many others can be implemented to give your organization a much better experience and add additional layers of security for your AVD environment.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Security-by-Using-Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud"><a href="#Managing-Security-by-Using-Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud" class="headerlink" title="Managing Security by Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud"></a>Managing Security by Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud</h1><p>Welcome to this module on managing security by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, formerly known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-azure-security-center/preventing-responding-security-threats-azure-security-center/">Azure Security Center</a>. We will cover the following topics in this module. We will discuss the requirements needed to integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-virtual-desktop-architecture-2046/azure-virtual-desktop-overview/">Azure Virtual Desktop</a>. We will then look at the features that are available. Finally, we will look at some general security best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop. </p>
<p>Let’s start off by taking a look at some of the requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to integrate Azure Virtual Desktop with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. There are two levels of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, basic and standard. Before you can integrate this service with AVD, you need to ensure you have enabled the standard tier in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Finally, you need to ensure you have provisioned your Azure Virtual Desktop environment and have active session hosts within this environment.</p>
<p>Let’s now move on to discussing some of the features that are available once you meet these requirements. The first feature I would like to highlight is the security configuration assessment, which will assess your existing security implementation within Azure Virtual Desktop. Next, we have a security score, which again assesses the AVD environment, but this time outputs a score, detailing vulnerabilities and how you can remediate those.</p>
<p>We move on to file integrity monitoring, better known as FIM. This feature examines operating system files, Windows registry, apps, and more for changes in behavior that might indicate an attack. I also want to mention Just-in-time VM access as an important feature. This feature allows you to control access to the sessions hosts and limit not only the level of access, but the amount of time a user can access a VM.</p>
<p>The final feature I will touch on is adaptive application control. This is an intelligent and automated solution for defining allow lists of known, safe applications for your session hosts. In the final part of this lecture, I will discuss general security best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop. An important aspect of AVD is the session host <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/getting-started-with-azure-virtual-machines-988/what-is-a-virtual-machine/">virtual machines</a>, so ensuring you have some type of endpoint protection enabled on these is very important.</p>
<p>With any type of cloud-hosted environment, security posture is key, and AVD is no different, which is why it is another best practice to continuously monitor and improve your secure score. Access and authentication are an important aspect of all cloud-hosted services, and as such, forcing users to utilize multi-factor authentication when accessing Azure Virtual Desktop should be standard. The final best practice recommendation I want to point out is to set up screen locks for idle sessions. This protects access to the environment if users walk away from their screens and leave the session unattended.</p>
<h1 id="Configuring-Microsoft-Defender-Antivirus-for-Session-Hosts"><a href="#Configuring-Microsoft-Defender-Antivirus-for-Session-Hosts" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Microsoft Defender Antivirus for Session Hosts"></a>Configuring Microsoft Defender Antivirus for Session Hosts</h1><p>Welcome to this module on Configuring Microsoft Defender Antivirus for Session Hosts. We will cover the following topics in this module. What is Microsoft Defender Antivirus? What are the requirements to run Microsoft Defender Antivirus in a VDI environment? We’ll take a closer look at the security intelligence updates for Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>Let’s start off by explaining what Microsoft Defender Antivirus is. This is next-generation protection services that are hosted by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-and-managing-a-microsoft-365-tenant/setup-microsoft-365-tenant-and-subscription/">Microsoft 365</a> and part of its wider security suite. It combines machine learning, big-data analysis and in-depth resistance research to offer a robust protection layer for Windows 11, 10 and Server OS. There are two modes.</p>
<p>First, we have Active mode which is utilized as the primary antivirus application on the device, so it remediates threats. And then, we have passive mode, where Microsoft Defender Antivirus is not utilized as the primary antivirus, so it does not remediate threats. As with most Microsoft Cloud services, there are a number of requirements that need to be met before it can be implemented with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/designing-azure-virtual-desktop-architecture-2046/azure-virtual-desktop-overview/">Azure Virtual Desktop</a>. From a licensing perspective, it is included as part of the Microsoft 365 E5, E3, E5 security, and A5 security subscriptions. It is supported on both server OS from 2008 R2 SP1 or higher and from Windows 7 SP1 and higher, including Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Finally, before you can turn this service on, you need to ensure you are using an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> account with the relevant role assigned to it, which includes Global Administrator, Security Administrator, and Compliance Administrator to name a few. In this final section of this module, we are going to discuss security intelligence for Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft continually updates security intelligence in antimalware products to cover the latest threats, and constantly tweak detection logic. This security intelligence works directly with cloud-based protection to deliver fast and powerful AI-enhanced, next-generation protection. Network Inspection System updates are designed to protect you from network threats, including exploits as they are transmitted.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>We have covered several important topics in this course. We started off by looking at planning and implementing conditional access policies for connection to Azure Virtual Desktop. In this section, we discussed the requirements needed to implement conditional access, and followed this up with a demo of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-security-azure-virtual-desktop-2356/planning-and-implementing-conditional-access-policies-for-connections-to-azure-virtual-desktop/">configuring a policy for Azure Virtual Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we moved on to discussing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-security-azure-virtual-desktop-2356/planning-and-implementing-multi-factor-authentication-in-azure-virtual-desktop/">planning and implementing multi-factor authentication in Azure Virtual Desktop</a> where we highlighted the requirements to enable MFA, and again followed up with another demo, but this time we looked at some of the settings you can implement to harden your MFA settings for Azure Virtual Desktop.</p>
<p>In the third section of this module, we had a look at managing security by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, formerly known as Azure Security Center. Here we focused on understanding the requirements needed before you can implement this service. We then discussed some of the key features of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-security-azure-virtual-desktop-2356/managing-security-by-using-microsoft-defender-for-cloud/">Microsoft Defender for Cloud</a>, and then finished off by highlighting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-security-azure-virtual-desktop-2356/configuring-microsoft-defender-antivirus-for-session-hosts/">some security best practices for Azure Virtual Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about configuring Microsoft Defender Antivirus for session hosts. We initially explained what this service is, followed by the requirements you need before you can integrate this with Azure Virtual Desktop, and we finished off by discussing security intelligence updates.</p>
