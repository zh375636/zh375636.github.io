<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course where I shall be looking at how AWS provides a variety of different means of authentication. My name is Stuart Scott and I’m the AWS Content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>, where one of our cloud experts will reply to your question. </p>
<p>This course has been created for those who are AWS administrators, security engineers, security architects, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of security and authentication within AWS. By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of the different methods of authentication that can be implemented when using AWS. The difference between username and password and multi-factor authentication. How to configure MFA authentication. </p>
<p>The process in which programmatic authentication is managed. How IAM roles can be used to authenticate and authorize EC2 instances to access resources. How key pairs are used to authenticate you to newly created EC2 instances, and the different options available with regard to Federated authentication. As a prerequisite to this course, you should have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of Amazon EC2, but this is not essential. </p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#x61;&#99;&#97;&#100;&#x65;&#109;&#121;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#x61;&#99;&#97;&#100;&#x65;&#109;&#121;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>. </p>

<h1 id="Username-Password-amp-MFA"><a href="#Username-Password-amp-MFA" class="headerlink" title="Username-Password &amp; MFA"></a>Username-Password &amp; MFA</h1><p>To begin with, I want to start talking about the AWS Identity and Access Management service. IAM is used to securely manage users who require access to your AWS account and resources. During the creation of user identities, there are components and features that you can use that affect how these users authenticate. The most basic is that of a simple username and password. These usernames must be unique as they identify you as an individual and therefore can’t be duplicated within the same account. The password however can be duplicated between different users. </p>
<p>For example, you can create 10 new IAM users, and as the administrator issue all of them with the same password. To enforce security at a greater and more granular level, IAM allows you to create and specify your own password policy for your users. This provides you with the opportunity to govern how secure you want your passwords in your environment to be. As you can see in this image, there are a variety of parameters that you can configure to adjust the policy to meet your own security standards and requirements. I would always recommend enforcing a tight security policy and adopting as many as these parameters as possible.</p>
<p>Using a username and password as your authentication mechanism, the username will be used to determine your identity, followed by verification in the form of the associated password, which must conform with your IAM password policy. On submission of the credentials, IAM will then verify if the authentication is successful and if the credentials do not match those held by IAM, access will be refused and you’ll be asked to re-enter the correct information. </p>
<p>If the authentication is successful, then the user will be authorized to access your AWS environment via the management console based on the permissions specified and associated with the IAM user. Just using a username and password for authentication is not generally considered very secure, and additional measures should be put in place, especially for those with elevated privileges. Within your IAM password policy, you might allow users to set their own passwords, and this can lead to the potential of the introduction of standard and weak passwords being entered, such as password in all lowercase, or 123456, qwerty, and letmein.</p>
<p>Although AWS allows you to enforce password policies, combinations of the above weak passwords still make their way in, such as password 123!, which is both upper and lowercase letters along with numeric and non-alphanumeric characters. However, from a security perspective, these common patterns should still be avoided. So, with this in mind, tighter security can be achieved with the use of additional authentication methods, which requires an additional level of authentication. IAM allows for Multi-Factor Authentication, MFA. This means that any user-configured to sign in with MFA must use a second step of authentication after entering the password as the first level to be authenticated, therefore giving a multi-factor layer of security. The additional authentication utilizes a random six-digit number that is generated by an MFA device that is displayed for a very short time period before the number changes again.</p>
<p>You must enter the digits displayed when prompted to verify this final step of authentication. There is no additional charge for this level of authentication, however you will need your own MFA device which can be a physical token or a virtual device. And AWS provides a summary of all supported devices here. Personally, I use Google Authenticator on my phone because it’s simple and easy to set up and configure. Before a user can authenticate with MFA, it must be configured and associated with the user. As we know as a part of the authentication process, we need to ensure that the verification part conforms the identity of the user. This configuration and association is done from within IAM. </p>
<p>And I will now show you how quick and easy this is to do via a quick demonstration. So, as you can see I’ve signed into my AWS Management Console and I’m within the AWS IAM dashboard. I’ve selected one of my users and then this is the screen I’m presented with from there. As you can see, we can manage the MFA device here. So, if I click on ‘Manage MFA’ for this user. We have a couple of options here: Virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or another hardware MFA device.</p>
<p>For this, I’m just going to use a virtual MFA device, and I’ll use the Google Authenticator app on my phone to do this, so click on ‘Continue.’ So, first of all, you need to make sure you have an app on your mobile phone or your computer. Like I said, I’m going to use the Google Authenticator app on my phone. So, what I need to do is to show the QR code. And now on my phone I’m going to add this as a new entry in my Google Authenticator app, so I’m going to click on ‘Scan QR Code.’ And then we can see at the bottom there is added the user, Patricia. </p>
<p>And then, we add in that code, so 074720. And then what we need to do is to add the second code that comes in when it appears on the Google Authenticator app. So, we just wait for that to come around then I can add in the second code, and then it will be synchronized and configured. So, this is about to change. And now I can add in the next code, 185887. And then, I click on ‘Assign MFA.’ And that’s it. So, you have successfully assigned a virtual MFA device to that user. Click on ‘Close,’ and now we can see here that there’s an assigned MFA device.</p>
<h1 id="Programmatic-Authentication"><a href="#Programmatic-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="Programmatic Authentication"></a>Programmatic Authentication</h1><p>Sometimes, if a user wants to access AWS resources, they don’t have to log into the AWS management console first. Instead, access can be gained from a programmatic perspective for a user who may be using the AWS command-line interface, the CLI, AWS API tools, tools for Windows PowerShell, or Software Development Kits, SDKs. When using any of these methods to access AWS resources, access is not granted via the AWS management console using your username and password. Instead, you’re accessing the resources programmatically and so you must authenticate differently. This is also typical of any application that calls upon functions of other services. When an identity is making programmatic calls to your AWS resources, their identity is not prompted to log into the environment first via the console. So, how do you authenticate to AWS resources?</p>
<p>But as we know, this has to happen before being authorized to perform any actions. What credentials are used and how is this authentication achieved? Identities, human or system, requiring this type of programmatic access to the AWS environment use access keys to authenticate. These access keys are composed of two elements: an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. The Access Key ID is made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters such as the one displayed on screen. The Secret Access Key is made up of 40 random upper and lowercase alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters as displayed. </p>
<p>These access keys can be created for any IAM user who requires programmatic authentication. When the keys are created, you are prompted to download and save the details as the Secret Access Key will only be displayed once. And if you lose it, then you’ll have to delete the associated Access Key ID and recreate new keys for the user. It’s worth noting that it’s not possible to retrieve lost access keys as AWS does not retain copies of these for security reasons to prevent them from being compromised. The access keys must then be applied and associated with your system or application that you require for the relevant access. </p>
<p>For example, if you’re using the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, you would first have to instruct the AWS CLI to use these access keys to authenticate and provide authorization for any programmatic API calls. The method of performing this association varies based on the application and system that you’re using. However, once this association has taken place, it ensures that all API requests made to AWS are signed with this digital signature. Before we move on, I want to give a quick demo on how we apply access keys to the AWS command-line interface using specific user’s credentials. To do this, you need to create a new access key from the security credentials tab of your IAM user and copy the access key ID and secret access key values. </p>
<p>In the following demonstration, Danny Jessee, our AWS certification specialist will now demonstrate how to use these keys to configure the AWS CLI. Once the CLI is installed, it adds a command called AWS to the system path, which I can then run from a Command Prompt along with various arguments corresponding to different AWS services, such as S3 or EC2. But before I can run any of these commands, I need to perform a one-time action to configure the credentials and default preferences I would like to use with the CLI. And to do that, I’m going to type aws configure, and first it’s going to ask me for an AWS access key ID. And so I’m going to use an access key ID from an IAM user who has already been assigned programmatic access credentials. And don’t worry, by the time you see this video, I’ll have long since deleted these credentials so they won’t be valid. </p>
<p>So, I’ll paste the access key ID here and then the secret access key. And now it’s asking me for a default region. So, you can add a – region parameter to your CLI commands to specify the exact region where you want to execute that command. But if you don’t supply this parameter, the region you specify here as your default will be used instead. So, I’ll enter us-east-1, and finally, it’s going to ask me for a default output format. And your choice here will depend on whether you prefer to see output in some sort of more friendly human-readable text format. So, my options are JSON, yaml, yaml-stream, text, or table. But for the purposes of this demo, I’ll choose text. And now that I’ve completed this initial configuration, I can begin to enter CLI commands, and these commands will execute using the credentials I just specified. </p>
<p>So, to interact with S3, I can run the command aws s3. And to list the buckets of my account, I can type ls. And here you see I have two demo buckets, but let’s say I want to add a third. So, now I can enter the command aws s3 then mb for make bucket. And the name of my new bucket will be s3:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudacademydemobucket3. And since my IAM user has permission to create an S3 bucket, this command will succeed. So, if I run aws s3 ls again, we see my newly created bucket now appears on this list. So, you see how I was able to create an S3 bucket by just running that one simple command. Now imagine if I needed to create 30 or 40 more buckets, it’s obviously much simpler and less tedious to leverage something like the AWS CLI to automate this process, rather than having to repeatedly walk through the various screens in the console.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier when talking about passwords and how it’s best practice to change the password after set period of time, the same principle applies when it comes to access keys. By rotating your access keys, you’re decreasing the likelihood of your environment or identities being compromised and gaining access to your environment. When rotating these keys, you should follow a simple five-point process to ensure you don’t lose access to your resources. Firstly, you should create a second access key. </p>
<p>Now, that includes both the access key ID and a secret access key for the same user. So, now the user has two access keys associated to them. Next, download these access keys when prompted as you won’t get the opportunity to do so again. Then associate these access keys with your application to start using the new access keys depending on what you’re using will depend on how you do this. For example, if you’re using the AWS CLI, then you would issue the command aws configure to add the new key information as we have just seen in the demonstration. Now, at this point you need to mark the existing access keys as inactive. </p>
<p>Before deleting this now inactive key, you should test your new access keys and verify that programmatic access is being allowed as expected. And then finally, delete the old access keys. As an authentication method from a programmatic perspective, access keys are a great solution. However, if you are applying access keys to applications running on EC2 instances to gain access to other AWS resources within your environment, then there is a more efficient and secure solution available. And in this instance, you should use IAM Roles.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Roles"><a href="#IAM-Roles" class="headerlink" title="IAM Roles"></a>IAM Roles</h1><p>IAM roles provide an efficient and secure solution in authenticating and authorizing access. And their usage is considered a best practice when associated with applications running on EC2 instances that require access to other resources instead of embedding credentials into the application itself. IAM roles are objects created within IAM and have a defined set of permissions associated to them, much like a normal user or user group would have. </p>
<p>However, they do not represent an identity like users do, they are simply an object with a list of authorized permissions associated. When working with Amazon EC2 instances, you can either associate a role to the instance during its creation or when it’s up and running. Once you have associated an EC2 instance with your IAM role, your application instances can then access and make API calls within AWS that are authorized by the permissions given by the role. </p>
<p>By having a role associated to the EC2 instance, there’s no need to apply access key IDs as we did previously. Instead, when your application attempts to access an AWS resource, dynamic temporary access keys will be supplied by the role to determine if access is authorized. Roles are not just for instances, they can also be assumed by a user, allowing them to switch from their current set of permissions to take the permissions given by the role. It’s important to note that permissions from the user and the IAM role are not amalgamated. </p>
<p>The permissions are swapped from the user to the IAM role. To switch to a role, permissions must first be given to the user allowing them to switch to that role, which authorizes them to use this new set of temporary permissions. Roles also take care of access key rotation as well, so there’s no need to perform your own rotation of access keys. </p>
<p>It’s more efficient to use roles for EC2 instances when requiring programmatic access over an IAM access key ID. This is because if you have multiple applications running on multiple EC2 instances, then when it comes to key rotation, you have a number of applications to associate the new keys to. To learn more about IAM roles, please see our existing course here.</p>
<h1 id="Key-Pairs"><a href="#Key-Pairs" class="headerlink" title="Key Pairs"></a>Key Pairs</h1><p>And now I want to talk about how you can authenticate to newly created instances. And the process is slightly different for Linux and Windows Operating Systems. But the underlying method is fundamentally the same through the use of key pairs. So, when you create an EC2 instance, you are asked to select an existing or create an EC2 key pair. So, what is a key pair and what does it do?</p>
<p>A key pair as the name implies is made up of two components: a public key and a private key. These keys can either be ED25519 or 2048-bit SSH-2 RSA keys. However, please note that ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances, EC2 Instance Connect, or EC2 Serial Console. The function of key pairs is to encrypt the login information for Linux and Windows EC2 instances and then decrypt the same information allowing you to authenticate onto the instance. </p>
<p>The public key uses public key cryptography to encrypt data such as the username and password. For Windows instances, the private key is used to decrypt the administrative password allowing you to gain access to the login credentials including the password using RDP. For Linux instances, the private key is used to SSH onto the instance, and the public key is held and kept by AWS. The private key is our responsibility to keep and to ensure that it is not lost. </p>
<p>So, going back to when you create your EC2 instance, you’re given the opportunity to download the key pair in the form of a pem file. Once you’ve done this, you must keep that file safe until you’re ready to log into the associated instance. It’s worth noting that you can use the same key pair on multiple instances. To understand the differences between connecting to a Windows instance and a Linux instance, please take a look at the following two labs where you will be shown how to create an instance and then connect to them using the key pairs.</p>
<h1 id="Federation"><a href="#Federation" class="headerlink" title="Federation"></a>Federation</h1><p>AWS allows you to access and manage AWS resources even if you don’t have a user account within IAM through the use of identity federation. Put simply, identity federation allows users from identity providers, IDPs, which are external to AWS to access AWS resources securely without having to supply AWS user credentials from a valid IAM user account. An example of an identity provider can be your own corporate Microsoft Active directory. </p>
<p>Federated access would then allow the users within it to access AWS. Other forms of identity providers can be any OpenID Connect Web Provider. Common examples of these are Facebook, Google, and Amazon. So, what does this mean? Well, this means that if you need users to access AWS resources that already have identities that fit into these categories, then you could allow access to your environment using these existing accounts, instead of setting up each of them with a new identity within AWS IAM, effectively allowing for a single sign-on solution. </p>
<p>As the vast majority of organizations today are using Microsoft Active Directory, this is an effective way of granting access to your AWS resources without going through the additional burden of creating IAM user accounts. As a part of the configuration process to implement federated authentication, a trust relationship between the identity provider and your AWS account must be established. AWS supports two types of identity providers, web identity federation and SAML 2.0 based federation. </p>
<p>Web identity federation allows authentication between AWS resources and any public OpenID Connect Provider, such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon. When it’s set up and configured and access is requested by a user to an AWS resource, then the identity provider will exchange an authentication token for temporary authentication credentials. And these credentials are associated to an IAM Role with pre-configured permissions allowing authorized access to the resource as defined by that role. SAML 2.0 based federations can allow your existing Active Directory users to authenticate to your AWS resources, allowing for a single sign-on approach. </p>
<p>SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, and allows for the exchange of security data, including authentication authorization tokens to take place between an identity provider and a service provider. In this case, the identity provider is Microsoft Active Directory service and the service provider is AWS. </p>
<p>To learn more about AWS Federation and SSO, please see your exiting course here. Also, if you’re looking to provide a means of authentication to your mobile web applications, then please see our existing course which covers Amazon Cognito here. It explores Amazon Cognito and how it can be used to manage authentication and authorization to your applications. And starts with a general overview of Amazon Cognito and when to use it. It then moves on to user pools and identity pools, and how Cognito can be integrated with your mobile and web apps to sync your application’s user data across various platforms.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>If you have a look at security from an identity and authentication perspective, you could leave yourself open to security loopholes, which in turn can lead to abuse from not only internal users but external as well. Security remains high on the list for importance when it comes to cloud computing, and having an understanding of it is beneficial to your whole company. It’s the one key topic that consistently gains attention and requires constant and considerable amount of effort to get right and implement efficiently. </p>
<p>In order to do this correctly, a clear understanding and definition of security terms are essential, such as the clear differences between authentication, authorization, and access control. If you want to be an effective security engineer, you need to know the differences between these terms to allow you to select an architect the right solution to meet your needs. There are so many different methods of authentication and granting permissions. </p>
<p>It can get a little overwhelming when selecting the most effective mechanism. However, when doing so, implement the most appropriate solution that meets the security level of the data and resources that you’re protecting. If the data resource is highly sensitive, then you would implement multiple levels of authentication, such as MFA, in addition to multiple levels of authorization. The more restrictions that are in place, the harder it is to breach. I would recommend you take a look at the labs we have here at Cloud Academy as there are a number of AWS labs covering security from introduction to IAM to setting and configuring advanced roles. </p>
<p>So, feel free to take a look at these in your own time to become more familiar on how to set these up within the real environment. That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of some of the different authentication mechanisms that are available for users within AWS. Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#x61;&#99;&#x61;&#100;&#x65;&#109;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#x61;&#99;&#x61;&#100;&#x65;&#109;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.
