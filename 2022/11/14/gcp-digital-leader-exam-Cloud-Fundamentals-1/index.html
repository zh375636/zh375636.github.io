<h1 id="Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Computing"></a>Cloud Computing</h1><p>So, exactly what is this “Cloud” thing that you keep hearing about? When people talk about the Cloud, they’re usually referring to Cloud computing. Cloud computing has been used heavily within the IT industry for many years now. More recently, it’s expanded into other sectors, such as retail and finance. As it becomes more and more popular, the technology is often simply referred to as “the Cloud.”</p>
<p>So if the Cloud means Cloud computing, then what is Cloud computing? Put simply, Cloud computing is a remote, virtual pool of on-demand, shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. Now, maybe that explanation makes sense to you, maybe it doesn’t. There might be a couple of terms that you’re not familiar with. Don’t worry. I’m going to break these down over the next couple of slides, after which, I’ll give you the definition again. And the next time, it should make more sense.</p>
<p>Before you can understand what Cloud computing is, you need to be aware of the technology that it’s based upon, that being virtualization. Virtualization has been used in on-premises data centers for a long time, and without virtualization, Cloud computing would not be possible. So then you ask, what is virtualization? Well, in essence, it allows you to create multiple virtual machines, or VMs, all of which run on a single server. Each of these VMs has its own operating system and set of applications. VMs can all run at the same time, completely independently, without being aware of each other’s existence. Yet, they all still share the same underlying hardware.</p>
<p>This sharing of resources is a key element of understanding virtualization, and it’s achieved through something called a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a piece of software used to create the virtualized environment. It sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines, and it creates a shared pool of virtual hardware resources for each of them to access. Any request from a VM to the hardware passes through the hypervisor, thus ensuring that the hardware resources are properly shared as needed.</p>
<p>Now, virtual machines can be called different things. Sometimes you’ll hear the term “instance,” or sometimes you’ll hear even “server.” These terms are vendor specific, but they can both mean the same thing as a virtual machine.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of virtualization, but here are the main ones. Number one, easily share resources. Virtualization makes it much easier for many different people to share the same hardware. You can have someone running Windows, and someone else running Linux, both at the same time and on the same number computer. Number two, less waste. Most computers are not constantly running at 100% utilization. Right now, your computer is probably only using a small fraction of its CPU and memory to play this video. Virtualization gives you access to previously unused resources. And so, it reduces the total number of computers needed. Number three, lower operating costs. With virtualization, you have less computers sitting idle. And less hardware means less space, power, and cooling that are required. Number four, more environmentally friendly. Less hardware that needs to be manufactured and less power consumed means virtualization also helps promote green computing, as well.</p>
<p>So these virtual machines can be used to build and share different types of resources, including compute, storage, database, and network. Now there are other types, as well, but we’ll stick to the main four for this course.</p>
<p>Compute resources provide on-demand processing power to complete your workloads. Whenever you have a program or a script that needs to run, compute resources can run for you. In your traditional on-premises data centers, these would be the equivalent to the physical servers that you could connect to remotely, and install, and run software on.</p>
<p>Storage resources allow you to save and retrieve your unstructured data. Any resource that allows you to store things like images or video in the Cloud is classified as a storage resource. In a traditional data center, you would have DAS, or directly attached storage, which includes hard and solid state drives. You might also have had things like NAS, or SAN, network attached storage, or storage area network.</p>
<p>Database resources allow you to store structured sets of data for use in your applications. So the equivalent here in your traditional data center would include databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL. And network resources, which allow you to control how all the other resources will communicate with each other. Now, in a traditional data center, this would include things such as routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers. In Cloud computing, these resources can either be directly managed by the end-user, or management can be abstracted away to create serverless offerings. Serverless does not mean that there are literally no servers or VMs. It just means that the VMs are hidden. Serverless offerings don’t require any knowledge or interaction with the underlying virtual machines. Instead, you can use a serverless service, and it will silently manage the VMs for you. So, for example, in a serverless database, whenever you need more storage or processing power, it’s automatically added in the background. Then, when less processing power is required, resources can be automatically removed. So you can use a serverless database without having to worry about upgrades, updates, or maintenance.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to our definition of Cloud computing and see if it makes more sense. Cloud computing is a remote, virtual pool of on-demand, shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. So, a Cloud vendor has a number of physical computers in multiple data centers, and they’re divided up into virtual machines. Now, these virtual machines are used to build compute, storage, database, network, and many other types of services. With Cloud computing, you have the ability to request and use as many of these virtual resources as needed. When you need to scale things up to meet a sharp increase in demand, you can do so.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Types"><a href="#Cloud-Types" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Types"></a>Cloud Types</h1><p>Even though people talk about the cloud as if it were a single thing, there are actually different types. There are public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. Now, each offers a different level of management, flexibility, security, and resilience.</p>
<p>Let’s start by talking about public clouds. A public cloud is a collection of virtual on-demand services that are offered to the public. The vendor essentially rents out use of its hardware to many different customers. Each customer can use what they want when they need it. Today, you might only need five web servers, but tomorrow you might need 500. The major cloud vendors are capable of providing more resources than you could possibly use. These resources are typically accessible from anywhere, as long as you have a working internet connection. All back-end maintenance, including power, cooling, upgrades, and repairs are handled by the cloud vendor. The customer will never actually see the hardware, nor will they know the exact physical location of their services or data. They’ll usually be able to specify the geographic region in which it resides. This allows them to have some control for data storage requirements, and for latency.</p>
<p>A private cloud is similar to a public cloud, but the main difference is that the resources are not shared to the general public. Typically, a company will create its own private cloud and share the resources among its various departments. Everything is hosted, managed, and owned by that company. This allows for direct control over the resources. Enterprises who wish to keep a tighter grasp on security might adopt this architecture. Now, maybe this sounds exactly like the on-premises data center approach, but the difference is that the private cloud uses the same cloud principles as the public. Different teams and different departments are provided on-demand access to the same pool of shared scalable resources. That means you no longer have certain machines dedicated to finance or human resources. Everyone shares the same resources. Accounting can use some VMs to crunch some numbers for a while, and then afterwards, marketing can use those same VMs to render a new video. Resources are shifted around as needed.</p>
<p>With this approach, the company has more control, but it also has a lot more responsibility. Private clouds require a lot of initial capital to purchase the hardware and to set up the data centers. Not only this, but additional resources will be needed to maintain everything. Now, individual departments will have more flexibility, but the company as a whole can’t use more resources than it currently physically owns. Plus, any unused resources still have costs associated with them.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud is literally the combination of public and private clouds. That is, you’ll have some dedicated resources in a private cloud for predictable workloads, but when you use up all available resources, you can always request more from a public cloud. Now the hybrid model is built by establishing a network link between your private cloud and a public cloud. Thus, you essentially extend the internal network of your private cloud. Now, in theory, this gives you the benefits of both models, so you can choose where each service most appropriately fits. However, in practice, the hybrid model tends to suffer from the negatives of both solutions. And because of this, hybrid clouds are typically short-term configurations. They often represent a transitional state for enterprises. It’s usually more of a way to bridge the transition from on-premises to a public cloud model.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Concepts"><a href="#Cloud-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Concepts"></a>Cloud Concepts</h1><p>Cloud computing has a number of key characteristics that allows it to become the powerful service that it is today. Let’s go through the main ones.</p>
<p>On-demand resourcing. This essentially means that when you want to provision a resource within the cloud, it’s almost immediately available to you. You allocate them when and where you need them. There’s no more waiting around for hardware to be ordered, installed, cabled, and configured before you can use it. It’s often as simple as filling out a form and clicking submit.</p>
<p>Consumption-based. With many cloud services, you only pay for what you use. What do I mean by this? Well, if you only have a server running for two hours and then you shut it down, then you’re only going to pay for two hours worth of compute resources. It’s just like your power bill at home and how you only pay for the electricity you use.</p>
<p>Scalability and agility. Cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment’s resources, both up and down and in and out. It depends upon the requirements and the demands of your application and services. When scaling up and down, you’re altering the power and performance of a particular instance. Perhaps you’re using one with greater CPU or memory power. When scaling in and out, you’re simply adding or removing instances to your fleet of compute resources. This gives you the ultimate flexibility to keep up with the ever-changing demands of the market. And it frees you up to try new things and experiment with much lower initial costs.</p>
<p>Economy of scale. Public cloud vendors can procure hardware for much cheaper due to bulk pricing. Also, it’s simply more economical to create and run large public cloud data centers rather than having each company with its own on premises. You, as the end user can benefit from these exceptionally low resource costs compared to traditional hosting.</p>
<p>Highly available. By design, many of the core services on the public cloud are replicated across different geographic zones and regions. That means that a disruption in one area does not have to result in any downtime. When one zone goes down, you can usually seamlessly switch to another. In this way, you can ensure the durability of your data and the availability of your services.</p>
<p>Flexibility and elasticity. Cloud computing offers huge flexibility and elasticity to your design approach. You can choose to have as many or as few resources as you require. You decide how much and how long you want it for, and at what scale. You have full control and can make fairly significant changes without worrying about waste.</p>
<p>Shared infrastructure. As discussed previously, multiple instances running on the same hardware significantly reduces the amount of physical hardware required. This in turn reduces the amount of power, cooling, and space required. All this results in cheaper costs for you, the customer.</p>
<p>Security. Now, this is one of the most discussed topics within cloud computing and many enterprises still have concerns. However, the major public cloud vendors are considered to be more secure than your own data center. The main vendors operate at an exceptionally high standard of security. They manage the security of the cloud by securing the data centers. And it’s up to you to ensure security in the cloud by correctly leveraging the tools, services, and applications available. If you copy your private information to a publicly accessible website, that’s on you. These are just some of the key characteristics of cloud computing. There are more, but these are typically the most important.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Service-Models"><a href="#Cloud-Service-Models" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Service Models"></a>Cloud Service Models</h1><p>There are many different types of services available in the cloud. These services can typically be grouped into a few different models. I’m now going to talk about the three most common, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. You’ve probably used many examples of software as a service, or SaaS, without even realizing it. SaaS offerings are ready to use applications. There’s nothing to install or maintain. Users can simply access the application over the internet. Probably one of the most well-known examples of this would be Google Gmail. Any user can sign in and access their email over the internet. You don’t have to install anything. As long as you can bring up a browser, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>SaaS offerings require little to no setup, but usually offer the least amount of customization. Platform as a service offers a greater level of control, but it requires more setup. Essentially, you’re given access to a certain environment and you can build or run whatever you want on it. The underlying architecture, the hardware operating system, and maybe even things like libraries, those are all managed by the cloud vendor. Basically this gives developers a simple platform to deploy and run code on. They can concentrate on writing software and they don’t have to waste a lot of time maintaining, upgrading and patching servers.</p>
<p>The highest level of customization offered is on infrastructure as a service. Now these services give you the option of architecting your own virtual data center. You can start out by configuring a virtual network with routers, firewalls and private IP address ranges. Then you can configure different virtual machine instances. You pick the operating system at the libraries, install any applications. It feels a lot closer to your traditional on premises data center. Now, this service does offer the highest level of customization and control, however, the underlying hardware is still managed by the vendor. So you’re not going to have complete control and there are going to be some limits on what you can and cannot change. Now, these aren’t the only service models available. You have other ones like disaster recovery as a service communications as a service and monitoring as a service. For the purposes of this course, we’re not going to go that deep. However, you should be aware that more and more of these services are popping up all over the industry.</p>
<h1 id="Common-Use-Cases-of-Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Common-Use-Cases-of-Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Common Use Cases of Cloud Computing"></a>Common Use Cases of Cloud Computing</h1><p>It’s great to understand the technical details of how cloud computing works. But in this section, I wanna provide you with some practical-use cases so that you understand how people typically use the cloud. Startups. One of the difficulties in creating a new startup company is the initial amount of work and overhead that are required. Technology-wise, you might have to build an entire IT department from scratch. You also probably need things like servers, networking, licenses, and a team to build everything out and keep it running. And, because a startup’s needs can radically change, purchasing a bunch of equipment and hiring employees that might not be needed tomorrow can be too risky. What if your customer base increases 100 times overnight? Will your company be able to keep up? In cases like these, partnering with a cloud vendor is a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Proof of concept. Similarly, the cloud is a great fit for research and development. If you need to build a proof of concept, the cloud can let you create it at a fraction of the cost. You don’t need a huge initial investment of capital. Access whatever resources you need and then evaluate. Is your prototype going to work? Will it be successful? Is it going to bring in enough revenue to justify its cost? You can use the results of your proof of concept to better predict success or failure before committing too many resources.</p>
<p>Traffic Bursting. A very common scenario for companies is to have periods of time where extra computing resources are required. Perhaps you’re in the retail business and the Christmas season brings with it additional shoppers and orders. In a classic data center environment, to handle the extra load, you would need to have extra hardware on hand that would mostly sit idle the rest of the year. A far better way to handle this would be to leverage on-demand resources from a public cloud. The major cloud vendors can scale to handle almost any load imaginable.</p>
<p>Backup and Disaster Recovery. Due to the public cloud’s built-in resiliency and durability, it makes for a great backup solution. If something like an earthquake or hurricane strikes the same area your systems are running, then you can simply move them to another location. With the cloud, you have access to virtually unlimited storage space. All of your data can have multiple copies, and those copies can be stored across many different locations. Physically relocating a new data center can take weeks, months, or even years. Moving around in the cloud might only take you a few minutes, depending upon your setup. It also can be significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>Cold or infrequently accessed storage costs much less than warm storage that holds frequently used data. So you can archive your backups for practically pennies. In the cloud, keeping detailed backups of everything is actually viable.</p>
<p>Websites and other Web-based Services. Many organizations choose to host their web services in the cloud due to its ability to rapidly scale up and down with demand. In addition, the wide geographic distribution of data centers, gives you the ability to place servers close to your users. It also allows you to access certain services like Content Delivery Networks, or CDNs. A CDN is a set of systems that redirects traffic to a nearby caching server. As a result, this can significantly reduce a website’s latency for its users across the globe.</p>
<p>Testing and Development Environments. Many companies do not have the extra resources available for proper testing and development. Financially speaking, they can just be too costly. Using the public cloud allows you to spin up servers for a short time and then shut them down when you’re finished. So if you need to occasionally build and test one of your products, you don’t need a set of dedicated machines.</p>
<p>Big Data. The cloud also makes it easier and cheaper to manage massive amounts of data, or big data. Building and maintaining specialized resources to handle huge data sets can be expensive and complicated. By using the cloud, you have access to specialized resources to make your analysis quicker and easier. Having some of these elements managed by a cloud vendor allows you to focus on the data and not worry about the underlying architecture.</p>
<p>Now, this was just a few examples, and there are many other use cases as well. At this point, you probably have a few ideas of your own.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-vs-On-Premises"><a href="#Cloud-vs-On-Premises" class="headerlink" title="Cloud vs On-Premises"></a>Cloud vs On-Premises</h1><p>In this section, I wanna talk about the main differences between the public cloud and traditional, on-premises data centers. You may be new to cloud computing, but I am going to assume that you already understand how on-premises data centers operate. I’m going to make several comparisons between it and cloud computing. When building and running your own data center, you have a quite the list of responsibilities. You need to worry about things like picking the right a location. You have to decide where it’s going to be physically located. You have to factor in things like the cost of land and property taxes. You need to make sure that you can access reliable power, reliable internet connection, and you need to make sure that you’re gonna have enough room for growth in the future.</p>
<p>Next, you’re gonna have to think about things like physical Security. This includes both external and internal. So you might have to hire a security team. You’re gonna have to install a bunch of locks and cameras and set some alarms. You need to consider things like mechanical and electrical infrastructure. That means you gotta think about things like air conditioning, setting up backup generators and UPS units, and you have to think about things like fire suppression.</p>
<p>Of course, those elements are just part of the building itself. You’re also gonna have to fill it with a bunch of hardware. So you’re gonna need a bunch of network infrastructure. That means things like switches, routers, and firewalls. You’re gonna need the physical machines and servers. This includes both hardware and software. And you’re gonna need lots and lots of storage. This includes hard drives, solid state drives, and things like NAS and SAN.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at each of these again, but this time from the perspective of using the cloud. Location. So depending on the size of your company, you might only have one or two data center locations. However, public cloud providers have locations all over the globe. And within each of these regions, they’re gonna have at least two data centers. Now, these data centers are kept separate so that if one goes down, the other is gonna be still be up and running. But they’re located close enough to each other to ensure high speed interconnectivity.</p>
<p>Physical security. As we’ve already discovered, the public cloud is operated, managed and maintained by the vendor. As a result, the end user has no access to the physical data center where the resources are located. It’s completely the vendor’s responsibility to ensure the correct certification and governance regarding security. Public cloud vendors adhere to the most stringent of controls, and for auditing purposes, you can access their compliance certifications online. Mechanical and electrical Infrastructure. Now, mechanical and electrical infrastructure, such as generators, are all situated at the data center itself. So as a result, the same rule applies. This is the vendor’s responsibility. So again, this burden is removed from the end user.</p>
<p>Network infrastructure. In the public cloud, you no longer have direct access to the network hardware. There’s no longer any way for you to physically install a switch or a router. The cloud vendor is responsible for setting that all up and maintaining that. All physical networking components have been replaced with virtual components. So in order for you to use this, you typically start by creating a virtual network. These virtual networks work pretty similarly to physical networks. You can segment them into different IP address ranges. You can set the different network segments to be either public facing or private. Routing and access control lists can also be configured for enhanced control. And once you have completed your virtual network, you can then provision your resources within these subnets.</p>
<p>Servers. Depending on your vendor, virtual machines are typically referred to as “instances.” But just as there are different types of physical servers, vendors offer different types of instances. For example, most providers offer instances that are optimized for running databases. Now, this is part of the benefit of the cloud. The vendors are capable of replicating the same functions that you use today, but usually with a lot more optimization and polish.</p>
<p>Storage. Now, storage is fantastic within the cloud. It’s essentially unlimited, it’s hugely scalable, and it’s highly durable. And as with compute, there are many different storage services, depending on what you need. These include both block-level and object-level storage. So, as you can see, the on-premises data center involves a lot more responsibilities, as well as a number of extra costs. Building your own data center requires significant upfront capital that often needs to be depreciated over a number of years. To help explain this, let me go a little deeper. So there are two main types of expenses in an organization. You have capital expenditures, or CapEx, and operating expenditures, or OpEx. Capital expenditures are major purchases that your company makes over the long-term. Operating expenses are the day-to-day expenses. So purchasing a company car would be a capital expense. Renting a car would be an operating expense. Capital expenditures generally can be a great way to save money when your needs are predictable. But unfortunately, business needs are rarely predictable. Will that new database server you just bought today work as well in two years? How many software licenses are you actually gonna be using six months from now? By leveraging the cloud, you can exchange your capital expenditures for operating expenditures. This “consumption-based model” can give your business the agility it needs to stay competitive in an ever-changing market. I have only skimmed the surface of the available services within the public cloud. Certain vendors will offer much, much more. However, I just wanted to point out how migrating your existing systems to a public cloud can bring significant benefits.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Fundamentals-Summary"><a href="#Cloud-Fundamentals-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Fundamentals - Summary"></a>Cloud Fundamentals - Summary</h1><p>Before we end, I wanna review some of the main points that we covered. First. What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources that can be rapidly deployed at scale. These resources include things like compute, storage, database, and networking services. What are the three types of clouds? We talked about public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. A public cloud is accessible by the public. A private cloud is kept private and only the people within a company can access that private cloud. And the hybrid cloud is a combination of the two. So you’ll have a private cloud that you use for some things, and for other things, you’ll use a public cloud. To help you understand the differences, I’ve created this simple table.</p>
<p>So, we can see here, for security, in the public cloud this is a shared responsibility model. The vendor manages the security of the infrastructure and the company is responsible for securing the software and services. Now in a private cloud, the security is the sole responsibility of the company. And of course, the hybrid is a combination of the two. It depends on where your services are. Some services will be in the public cloud, and those will have the shared responsibility model. Services running in the private cloud will be the sole responsibility of the company.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to data location, in a public cloud, the company gets to specify an area, but never quite knows the exact physical location. With a private cloud, the company has full control and knowledge about the location of their data and services. And the hybrid cloud has a combination. Again, it depends on if your services and data are running in the private cloud or the public cloud.</p>
<p>Now, for capital expenditures, there’s absolutely none in the public cloud. You don’t have any upfront costs. With the private cloud, it’s the exact opposite. Your capital expenditure will be very high. Everything needs to be paid for and built upfront. Now, with the hybrid, it’s somewhere in between. It really depends upon the size of your private cloud. For operational expenditures, this is gonna be variable in the public cloud. As you use more resources, your costs are gonna go up. As you use less, it’s gonna go down.</p>
<p>Now, in the private cloud, this is also going to be high, because you’ve had to pay for all your resources, whether you use them or not. Sure, you might save a little bit on electricity when a server’s sitting there idle, but you already paid for the hardware and you’re paying for the team to maintain it and monitor it. In the hybrid model, again, this is gonna be mixed. It’s gonna depend upon the size of your private cloud. For tenancy, in the public cloud, resources are typically shared between multiple companies. So, maybe you and a major competitor are actually using different parts of the same server.</p>
<p>Now, in some public clouds, there’s certain resources that can be dedicated to a specific company if needed for regulation purposes. In a private cloud, you don’t have to worry about this at all. There’s only ever a single tenant for every resource. And again, in the hybrid model, it’s a combination of the two.</p>
<p>All right, next, what were the three main cloud service models? Well, we talked about software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service. Now, in software as a service, remember, everything’s handled for you. It’s essentially on demand software. In platform as a service, you’re provided a pre-configured environment and you can use that to install and run software. So, you’re responsible for the application that’s ran, but everything else is taken care of for you by the vendor. In infrastructure as a service, you have a lot more freedom, but more responsibilities. The physical machines and the core infrastructure is taken care of for you, but you’re responsible for provisioning, installing and configuring everything else.</p>
<p>I hope you now have a good understanding of what cloud computing is, as well as how it can be used to create secure, reliable, and scalable systems. Well, that’s all I have for you today.
