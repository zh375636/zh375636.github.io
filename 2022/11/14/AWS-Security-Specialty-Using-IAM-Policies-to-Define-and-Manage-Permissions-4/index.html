<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course, where I shall be looking at how IAM Policies can be used to allow you to both grant and restrict access to your resources within your AWS account. I shall be looking at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/iam-aws-policy-types/">different types of policies</a>, in addition to the syntax of them, and how to interpret a policy. My name is Stuart Scott, and I’m the AWS Content Director here, at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions, using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us, here at Cloud Academy, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>, where one of our Cloud Experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this course has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles; an AWS administrator, security engineer, security architect, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS certification. By the end of this course, you will have a greater understanding of the different types of IAM policies you can expect to see when working within IAM; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/creating-an-aws-iam-policy/">how to implement policies</a> effectively to build secure and robust access controls for your users; how to read IAM policies to understand the permissions they are granting and restricting; and how <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-iam-policies-define-manage-permissions-2256/policy-evaluation-logic/">policy evaluation logic</a> operates.</p>
<p>As an intermediate course, you should already have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of its core services, but this is not essential.</p>

<h1 id="IAM-AWS-Policy-Types"><a href="#IAM-AWS-Policy-Types" class="headerlink" title="IAM AWS Policy Types"></a>IAM AWS Policy Types</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I want to talk about four different policy types that you can expect to see when working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam/introduction-81/">AWS IAM</a>. Identity-based policies. These policies can be attached to users, user groups or roles within IAM. Essentially, any entity that depicts an identity. Resource-based policies. Instead of being associated with an identity, these policies are attached in line to resources themselves. An example of a resource-based policy in IAM will be that of a role trust policy where the policy defines the principle that can assume the role.</p>
<p>Permission boundaries. These policies can be associated with a role or user, but they don’t actually grant permissions themselves, instead they define the maximum level of permissions that can be granted to an entity. Organization service control policies, SCPs. These are very similar to permission boundaries in the fact that they do not grant permissions. They define a boundary of maximum permissions. However, these service control policies are associated with an AWS account or organizational unit, an OU, when working with AWS organizations and govern the maximum permissions to the members of those accounts.</p>
<p>With all of these policy types, it’s easy to see why some people can get confused as to which type of policy is being used or should be used. So let me run through each of these policies in greater detail, starting with the identity-based policies.</p>
<p>As already highlighted, these policies can be attached to users, user groups, or roles and they control what permissions each of those entities have. Identity-based policies can either be managed or inline policies, but what does this mean? Well, managed policies are saved within the IAM library of policies and can be attached to any user, user group or role as and when required, and the same policy can be attached to multiple entities.</p>
<p>Managed policies also come in two different flavors, AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. AWS managed policies are policies that have been pre-configured by AWS and made available to you to help you manage some of the most common permissions that you may wish to assign. Some examples of AWS managed policies can be seen here. From the policy name, you can usually tell what access is being given, although you can expand upon each policy to see the JSON document that is associated.</p>
<p>Customer managed policies are those that you have created yourself, which can then be associated with a user, user group or role. You might want to create customer managed policies when the AWS managed policies do not meet your security requirements. For example, you might want to add additional granularity to the policy to restrict access at a specific API call level.</p>
<p>Let me now explain how inline policies contrast against managed policies. So inline policies are embedded directly into the entity, either the user, user group or role. The policy is not saved and stored in the IAM library policy, its only existence is within the associated entity. As a result, it can’t easily be replicated to other entities, it’s specific to that one user, user group or role, creating a one-to-one relationship. It’s not always best practice to use inline policies as they take a lot of administration to keep on top of and should only be used if absolutely necessary. For example, you might have some elevated permissions that you don’t want to have mistakenly given to someone else that they weren’t intended for.</p>
<p>Okay, let me now move onto resource-based policies. So resource-based policies are effectively inline policies that are associated with a resource instead of an identity. If you have been using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-to-amazon-s3/introduction/">Amazon S3</a> for any extended period of time, then you may have come across S3 bucket policies, which is a common resource-based policy where permissions to the bucket are defined at the resource level and defined which principle or principles can access the bucket based upon different actions.</p>
<p>When using roles within IAM, the role has a trust relationship policy, which is a resource-based policy. As a result, the permissions of the trust are embedded inline within the role itself. So in this instance, the resource is the role and the resource-based policy is the trust relationship. This example shows the resource-based policy of the trust relationship of one of my roles. In this policy, the user, Stuart is the principle and has the ability to assume the role. It is this parameter of principle which signifies the difference between an identity-based policy and a resource-based policy.</p>
<p>Identity-based policies don’t have that principle parameter as the policy is already associated within the identity. Resource-based policies must have the principle parameter to determine which identity that the policy permissions relate to. Next up, we have permission boundaries. So permission boundaries can only be associated with a user or role. It’s not possible to add a boundary to a group. They differ from both identity-based and resource-based policies in the fact that permission boundaries don’t grant permissions themselves. They act as a guide rail to limit the maximum level of permissions that the user or role can be given. The policy configured for the boundary can be an AWS managed or customer managed policy.</p>
<p>So let’s assume for example, that our user, Stuart has an identity-based policy associated with him that allows full access to S3 and full access to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2/amazon-ec2/">EC2</a> using the following AWS managed policies. However, if a permission boundary was also configured for Stuart using the following AWS managed policies, which only grants read only access to S3, but still full access to EC2, then the resulting access for the user, Stuart would be full access to EC2, but only read only to Amazon S3 as the maximum permission defining by the permissions boundary was limited to read only despite the user having an identity-based policy associated granting full S3 access.</p>
<p>So the last policy I want to reference are the SCPs, the service control policies. So service control policies are used by AWS organizations and attached to AWS accounts or organizational units, OUs, to define the maximum permissions allowed for the members of the associated account or OU. So in a way they act in a similar fashion to that of permission boundaries, but at the account level and affect all members of those accounts.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS and EC2 via an identity-based policy. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2 despite having full access to S3. The SCP would serve to prevent service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<p>So to be clear, an SCP does not grant access, they add a guide route to define what is allowed. You’ll still need to configure your identity-based or resource-based policies to identities, granting permission to carry out actions within your accounts. If you want to use service control policies to help you manage your security at an account level, then you need to ensure that you deploy AWS organizations using the enable all feature setting.</p>
<p>Within IAM, you have the ability to view any SCPs that are applicable to your AWS account, the policy statement itself, it’s ARN, the number of entities it affects and you can also review access activity to learn when a principal within the organization last accessed a service. However, if you wanted to update or edit the SCP, then you’d have to do that from within the AWS organization service itself. The SCP can’t be edited from within IAM. For more information relating to how to implement, manage and secure AWS organizations using SCPs, then please see our existing course here.</p>
<h1 id="Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure"><a href="#Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Examining the JSON Policy Structure"></a>Examining the JSON Policy Structure</h1><p>In this lecture, I will be taking a deep look at the syntax and structure of IAM policies. For both identity-based and resource-based policies, the syntax is the same, but you might use slightly different parameters. If you’ve worked with IAM at all before, then I am sure you have come across an IAM policy. After all, it is the component that defines what an identity can or can’t access. But what do these policies actually look like? IAM policies are formatted as JSON documents, JavaScript Object Notation, and each policy will have at least one statement where the structure may look like this example.</p>
<p>Let me break the structure of this policy down to allow you to understand each element. Version. This specifies the policy language version and specifies the language syntax used, and at the time of writing this course, the current policy version is 2012-10-17. Statement. This defines the main element of the policy, which will includes other sub-elements, including the Sid, Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition. These elements will identify the level of access granted or denied and to which resource. A policy must contain at least one statement, but it can also contain an array of statements. For each statement block, it must be enclosed within curly braces, but if you use an array of statements, then you must enclose the entire array within square brackets. And we shall look at an example of this during this lecture.</p>
<p>Sid. This is the statement ID, and it’s an optional parameter that allows you to set a unique identifier within the statement. As you add more arrays within your policy, it can be a good idea to include a Sid for each one, allowing you to name them appropriately, making them more easily identifiable. For example, AllowGetObjectForS3. Without reading the rest of the statement, you can get a good idea of what the permissions in this statement allows.</p>
<p>Effect. This element can be set to either Allow or Deny, which either grant or restrict access for the actions defined in the statement. By default, all access to your resources are denied and so, therefore, if this is set to Allow, it replaces the default denied access. Similarly, if this was set to Deny, it would override any previous Allow. An explicit Deny in a policy will always take precedence over any Allow.</p>
<p>Principal. This parameter defines which principal the policy relates to. The Principal is only used for resource-based policies, for example, those policies attached to S3 Buckets. When using identity-based policies, this parameter is not required within the policy as the policy itself is associated with the principal and not a resource. As an alternative to the Principal parameter, this could be replaced with the NotPrincipal parameter, which would specify the user, role, or AWS account that is not allowed or denied access to the associated resource.</p>
<p>Action. This is the action that will either be allowed or denied, depending on the value entered for the Effect parameter. Actions are effectively API calls for different services. As a result, different actions are used for each service. For example the DeleteBucket action is available for S3 but not EC2, and likewise, the CreateKeyPair action is available for EC2 but not S3. The action is prefixed with the associated AWS service. This example defines two actions, CreateTrail and DeleteTrail, for the CloudTrail service. As another example, you can see this one here with the asterisk, and this acts as a wildcard which represents all actions for the CloudTrail service, essentially granting full access to the service.</p>
<p>Similarly, as we had with the Principal parameter, we could replace the Action parameter with the NotAction instead, and this could help you optimize your policy by creating a shorter version, listing just a limited set of actions that should not match instead of creating a longer policy listing all that actions that should. An example of using the NotAction is shown here. This policy essentially allows all actions for CloudTrail apart from the DeleteTrail API, and this is because the NotAction parameter is being used.</p>
<p>Resource. This element specifies the actual resource you wish the Action and Effect to be applied to. AWS uses identifiers known as ARNs, Amazon Resource Names, to specify specific resources. Typically, ARNs follow a syntax of, arn, partition, service, region, account-id, and then resource. So the Partition element, this relates to the partition that the resource is found in. For standard AWS regions, this would be AWS. Service. This reflects the specific AWS service, for example, S3 or EC2.</p>
<p>Region. This is the region where the resource is located. Some services do not need a region specified, so this can sometimes be left blank. Account-ID. This is your AWS Account ID, without hyphens. Again, some services do not need this information and so can be left blank. Resource. The value of this field will depend on the AWS service you are using. For example, if I were using the action, Action:s3:PutObject, then I could use the bucket name that I wanted those permissions to apply to. Again, we also have a NotResource parameter that can be used to explicitly match all other resources except those specified. For example, this policy will allow access to all S3 buckets other than those specified by the NotResource parameter.</p>
<p>Condition. This is an optional element that allows you to control when the permissions will be effective based upon set criteria. The element itself is made up of a condition and a key value pair and all elements of the condition must be met for the permissions to be active. Let’s take a look at an example condition. In the example, the IP address is the condition itself, which the key value pair will be effective against. The aws:SourceIp is the Key and the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 is the value element of the key. So effectively, what this is saying is, if the Source IP address of the user who is requesting access via the policy is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range, then implement the permissions in the policy statement.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gone through the core parameters of an IAM policy, let’s take a look at a couple of examples to ensure we can understand the permissions that are being presented within the policy. As I mentioned previously, you can have multiple Sids within a statement, each granting a different level of access. The example below demonstrates this, and I have highlighted each a different color to show the separation.</p>
<p>So looking at this example policy, let’s determine what access is being granted. So in StatementBlock1, this allows any resource full access to CloudTrail on the condition that their source IP address is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range. StatementBlock2. This allows full access to all RDS databases using all API calls except for that of the rds:DeleteDBInstance due to the NotAction parameter being used instead of the Action being used. And in StatementBlock3, this allows the creation and deletion of S3 Buckets within the cloudacademy bucket on S3.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at another example policy, this time, a resource-based policy, and in this instance, it’s from an S3 bucket. So in this policy, it allows the user, Stuart, as highlighted by the Principal parameter, to create and delete buckets in addition to deleting the bucket policy. Stuart can also delete and put objects within the bucket, and the bucket that this policy refers to is the bucket named ca-bucket-uk, as defined by the Resource parameter. However, there is a condition bound to this policy that states that Stuart can only do this if he was authenticated via Multi-Factor Authentication, MFA. That should now give you more of an understanding of how JSON IAM policies work and what they look like.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy"><a href="#Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Creating an AWS IAM Policy"></a>Creating an AWS IAM Policy</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I will show you how to create your IAM policies. Let’s start by creating an identity-based, customer managed policy, and there are a number of ways to create a customer managed policy, these being, copy an existing AWS Managed Policy. So we can copy an existing policy and then edit that policy to ensure it meets the requirements we need, and this can save us some time.</p>
<p>We can use the Policy Generator, and this allows you to create a customer managed policy by selecting options from a series of dropdown boxes. And we can also create our own policy. So if you’re proficient in JSON and the syntax of IAM policy writing, then you can write your own policies from scratch or paste in a JSON policy from another source. So I now want to give you a quick demonstration on how to create a policy in each of these three ways. And the demonstration will include, how to create a customer managed policy by editing an existing AWS managed policy, how to create a customer managed policy using the Policy Generator, and how to create a customer managed policy from scratch. So let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS Management Console, and I’m at the IAM dashboard, and I’ve gone into Policies. So from here, we can create a number of different IAM policies. And the first method I’m going to show you is how to copy and import an existing AWS managed policy to create your own, if you need to make a few changes to it. So let’s go ahead and do that now. So from here, we need to go across to Create Policy.</p>
<p>Now, from here, we have an option on the top right here called Import Managed Policy, and that’s what we want to do. I want to import an AWS managed policy and then make a couple of small changes to it. So if I select Import Managed Policy and then find the policy that I want to find. So let’s, for example, look at AmazonS3FullAccess, import that, and we can see here that it’s imported the data. And if we look at the JSON tab, we can actually see the JSON format of that policy, and from here, we can directly make changes.</p>
<p>So for this quick demonstration, I want to copy this existing policy, but instead of allowing any resource, I want to specify my own resource for this, which will mean instead of this policy being, allow full access to Amazon S3, it allow full access to a specific bucket on Amazon S3. So let me go ahead and make those changes now. So I’m gonna change the asterisks from Resource and put in my own specific ARN of a bucket. So now, I’ve changed the resource to my own ARN.</p>
<p>So now, all I need to do is click on Next, go to Tags, and I can add any optional tags if I want. I’m just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Go across to Review, and here I can give this new policy a name. So I can call it S3FullAccessToMyBucket. And description, this allows full S3 access to ca-bucket-uk. And it gives you a summary of the policy here. So we can see the service that it’s using, the access level, and also the resource. Once we’re happy with that, we can simply click on Create Policy. And we can see that that policy has now been created.</p>
<p>Now, if we have a look at that policy, just by clicking on it there, it’ll take us straight to it, and we can see the JSON version of the policy. So that’s a very quick and easy way if you want to save yourself some time by copying existing S3 managed policies that are already there. Now, I chose a fairly simple policy just for demonstration, but there are some quite complex policies that AWS already have that you might need to just tweak a few changes to so you can simply import those existing managed policies, make your changes, and then save it as a new customer managed policy.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s the first method covered. Now, next, I want to show you how to create a policy using something called the AWS Policy Generator. Now, if you simply go to Google and type in the AWS Policy Generator, then it’ll come up straight away, and you’ll be brought to a page like this. Now, the actual URL of this Policy Generator, if you’d prefer to type it in, is awspolicygen.s3.amazonasw.com&#x2F;policygen.html. So this is a Policy Generator, and it allows you to easily create different types of AWS policies.</p>
<p>So if we look at this drop down list here, we can create an SQS policy, an S3 bucket policy, which, as we know, is a resource-based policy, a VPC endpoint policy, an IAM policy, and an SNS topic policy. We’re interested in the IAM policy. So if we select that, now, in step two, we can add our statements. Now, here, we have our effect, which can be allow or deny. So let’s say allow for this example. And then, we can select the service that we’re interested in. Let’s select Amazon S3 to keep it nice and simple. And now, we can select our actions.</p>
<p>Now, we can select individual actions here just through these tick boxes for any actions that we’re interested in. So I’ll just select a number of different ones there. And you can see here that it’s selected five actions. If you wanted all actions, you would simply tick this box. And then, you’d put in the ARN of the bucket. So let’s just put in that same bucket that we used in the previous example. And then, here, we can also add in any conditions that we’d like. So just through a series of dropdown boxes, you can specify any conditions that you’d like in there as well. And then, once you’re happy with your policy, simply select Add Statement. And here, it breaks down a summary as well. So it shows the effect, the action, the actions that we selected, the resource, and if there’s any conditions, which we didn’t specify any.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to, we can now add an additional statement. So for example, if we wanted to add some RDS elements in here as well, we can select AWS Service, select a load of actions, put in the ARN of your RDS database, and also add that statement to the same policy. Then, once you’re happy with your policy and the number of statements that you’ve added, simply click Generate Policy. And here, it shows you the JSON view of the policy that you would need based on your dropdown selection. So what you can do now is simply copy that, go back to IAM, go to your policies, Create Policy, go to the JSON tab, and simply paste it in. So it’s a very quick way of creating a policy through a series of dropdown boxes. And again, you can just progress through, adding any tags that you need to do, give this a name, ThisIsMyPolicy, and then click Create Policy. And again, you can see that this has been created. You can select that. And again, we can see the JSON statement there.</p>
<p>So now, we’ve looked at how to create a policy by copying an existing AWS managed policy. We’ve looked at how to use the AWS Policy Generator. Now, let’s just quickly review how to create a policy from scratch. So again, go back to Policies and then Create Policy. Now, you can either use this visual editor or go straight to JSON, and you can start typing out your policy in here as and how you need it, or you can use the visual editor, which is very similar to the Policy Generator we just looked at, where, again, you can choose a service, then the specific actions, say all S3 actions, then you can specify the resources, whether you want this, again, as an access point, a bucket, a job, an object. So you can say any object. Then, you can specify any conditions, if you need MFA or specific source IP, for example. And again, you can also add additional permissions here.</p>
<p>So almost like another statement. It’s very similar to the Policy Generator. But for me, personally, I think the Policy Generator is slightly easier to understand. And then, once you have your settings as you want them, and this has all been pre-filled from the options from the visual editor, and, again, click Tags, then Review, and then give this a name, MyPolicy, and then go to Create Policy. And if we take a look at the policy, we can just see its details again. And again, this shows the JSON view, et cetera. And if we wanted to edit the policy directly here, then we can. Click on Edit. Then, we can either edit through the visual editor, or we can directly edit the JSON view as well. So that’s just a couple of ways of creating your IAM policies in a few very simple steps.</p>
<h1 id="Policy-Evaluation-Logic"><a href="#Policy-Evaluation-Logic" class="headerlink" title="Policy Evaluation Logic"></a>Policy Evaluation Logic</h1><p>Every time someone tries to access a resource within AWS, the request is processed through a series of steps. One of which involves evaluating the level of permissions based upon the policies that are used. So let’s take a look at the whole process to understand how access is either granted or denied. And we can start with a simple four step process. So firstly authentication. We must first ensure that the principle sending the request is authenticated as a valid user.</p>
<p>Next, the context. Once authentication of the principle has been established, AWS then needs to determine the context of the request that is being asked, for example, what service or action is being requested. And this ensures that the relevant policies can be highlighted based on the request. We then have policy evaluation, and this is the part that we are interested in. Based on the request, there may be multiple policy types that need to be reviewed to determine the level of access, and I shall cover this in greater detail as we go through this lecture. And then finally, the result. AWS will determine if access is allowed or denied based upon the evaluation of all policies used.</p>
<p>So for this lecture, I want to focus purely on the third point, the policy evaluation and how that process is carried out. The rules for reviewing permissions across multiple policies in a single account is actually quite simple and can be summarized like this: by default, all access to a resource is denied. Access will only be allowed if an Allow has been specified within a policy associated with the principle. If a single Deny exists within any policy associated with the same principle against the same resource then that Deny will overrule any previous Allow that might exist for the same resource and action. So to reiterate, an explicit Deny will always take precedence over an Allow.</p>
<p>Now, there is an order in which policies are evaluated, and the following list of policies are shown in the order of evaluation. So firstly, we have any Organizational Service Control Policies. Then any Resource-based policies, then IAM permission boundaries, and then finally Identity-based policies. So let’s look at an example scenario. Let’s assume that the user, Stuart, is requesting to upload an object to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk using the s3:PutObject API.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s assume we have the following policies in place to see what happens at each step of the evaluation. So firstly, the evaluation will review any organization SCPs in place, and here is our example SCP. So this SCP will simply deny all access to RDS. So there is no Deny in place that affects the s3:PutObject requested by Stuart so the evaluation continues. Next, the evaluation will identify any resource-based policies, and here we have a Bucket Policy associated with the ca-bucket-uk as shown.</p>
<p>Again, there is no Deny here for the request in question, so the evaluation continues. Next, we have IAM Permission Boundaries. And this IAM Permission Boundary Policy is set on the user, Stuart. So this policy sets out a maximum permission boundary of full access to s3. Remember, permission boundaries do not actually grant permissions, they set the maximum privilege level, as full access to s3 allowed, the evaluation continues.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the evaluation of any Identity-based Policies, and this policy is associated to the group that the user, Stuart, belongs to. So as we can see, this policy allows any s3 action to the ca-bucket-uk. As a result, this permits Stuart to upload an object using s3:PutObject to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk. So the final decision upon the policy evaluation is to allow the request.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Welcome to the final lecture of this course where I shall summarize the key points taken from the previous lectures. I began by looking at the different IAM policy types, and here I covered the following. And I started with Identity-based policies. These policies can be attached to Users, User Groups or Roles. They can be managed or inline policies. The managed policies can be AWS managed or customer managed. AWS managed policies are pre-configured by AWS and customer managed policies are created by us as customers. And inline policies are embedded directly into the entity, either the User, User Group or Role, creating a 1-2-1 relationship.</p>
<p>Then we have Resource-based policies. And these are policies associated with a resource instead of an identity. So, S3 bucket policies are a common resource-based policy. Trust relationship policies are also a resource-based policy and resource-based policies must have the ‘Principal’ parameter to determine which identity that the policy relates to. Permission boundaries. Permission boundaries can only be associated with a User or Role. They do not grant permissions, they act as a guardrail to limit the maximum level of permissions that the User or Role can be given. And the policy can be an AWS managed or customer managed policy. And then we have Organization Service Control Policies, SCPs. And these are used by AWS Organizations and attached to AWS accounts or Organizational Units, OUs, to define the maximum permissions allowed for the members of the associated account or OU. And they operate at the account level. SCPs do not grant access, they add a guardrail to define what is allowed. And don’t forget, you still need to configure your identity-based policies or resource-based policies.</p>
<p>To use SCPs you need to ensure that you deploy AWS Organizations using the enable all features setting. Next I looked at the JSON policy structure and broke down the different parameters of the policy which included the following. Version, this specifies the policy language version. Statement, this defines that main element of the policy. The Sid, the Statement ID, and this is an optional parameter that allows you to set a unique identifier within the Statement. Effect, this element can be set to either Allow or Deny.</p>
<p>The Principal, this parameter defines which principal the policy relates to. And the Principal is only used for resource-based policies. Action, this is the action that will either be allowed or denied. Resource, this element specifies the actual resource you wish the Action and Effect to be applied to. Condition, and this is an optional element that allows you to control when the permissions will be effective based upon set criteria. I then gave a demonstration showing you how to create different IAM policies using a variety of different methods. Then finally I broke down the process of how IAM evaluates permissions when multiple different types of policies are involved. And in this lecture we learnt that when a request to access a resource is triggered, AWS will ensure that the identity is authenticated, it will then determine the context of the request, at which point policy evaluation will take place before determining if the request is allowed or denied.</p>
<p>By default all access is to a resource is denied. Access will only be allowed if an Allow has been specified within a policy associated with the principal, and a Deny will overrule any previous Allow. IAM Policy types are evaluated in the following order. Organizational Service Control Policies, Resource-based Policies, IAM Permission Boundaries, and then finally, Identity-based Policies. That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of how you can use IAM Policies to define and manage permissions across your account. </p>
