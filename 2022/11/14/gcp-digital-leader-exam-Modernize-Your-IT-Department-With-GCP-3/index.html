<h1 id="Digital-Transformation"><a href="#Digital-Transformation" class="headerlink" title="Digital Transformation"></a>Digital Transformation</h1><p>If you are taking this course, then you should already be aware of some of the benefits of using the cloud. Most people have tried out at least one of Google’s services (Google Search, GMail, Android Phone, or Google Docs) and so you have already had a taste of the scale and power available. Today these products reliably and consistently serve over a billion users worldwide. Google has spent incredible amounts of time and money building up its infrastructure. And today that very same infrastructure is available to you.</p>
<p>So you have seen what the cloud has done for Google. But today I want to talk about what the cloud can do for you. If you are building a company from scratch, then starting out on the cloud makes a lot of sense. A startup needs flexibility and agility. Today you are going to try something, and tomorrow could be completely different. This makes the cloud a perfect fit. However, what if your company has been around for a while? You might have an extensive history, and that usually comes with layers of legacy hardware and software. Switching to the cloud certainly will take more effort. However, even well-established companies can gain many benefits.</p>
<p>Technology changes rapidly. Anything built today becomes obsolete tomorrow. If your company has been around for more than a few years you probably have a lot of outdated, but mission-critical systems. Everything was built for the needs of the past, and your existing infrastructure may not have the speed, scale or flexibility to meet the needs of tomorrow. Probably one of your main struggles is balancing maintenance of the old with the creation of the new. You need some way to keep your existing systems up and running, while also being able to make significant changes for growth. A lot of companies simply do not have the resources to do both well at the same time. In order to keep up, you need a paradigm shift. A complete “digital transformation” if you will.</p>
<p>Today, customers expect everything to be fast, accessible from anywhere, and to have almost no downtime. If your offering is slow, then your customers will switch to a faster competitor. If your service is restricted to certain geographic regions, then you limit your market share. You also risk alienating international customers who may operate in multiple regions. And if your service goes down unexpectedly, then you could be sacrificing your reputation, your customer satisfaction, and your revenue.</p>
<p>Google has set a high bar. In order to keep up with modern demands, you need to offer the same level of speed, scale and security. And what better way to accomplish this, than by using the exact same infrastructure and tools?</p>
<h1 id="Benefits-of-Modernization"><a href="#Benefits-of-Modernization" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Modernization"></a>Benefits of Modernization</h1><p>The end goal of digital transformation is modernization. Now when it comes to modernizing your IT department, there are three primary areas to focus on: infrastructure, business platforms, and applications.</p>
<p>Your first area of focus should be on modernizing your infrastructure. This involves replacing your existing physical systems with virtual infrastructure in the cloud. Think about it.  If your company needs a car, it probably doesn’t make sense to build your own. Instead, you want to lease a car built by a company of experts. So why would you spend so many resources on building a custom data center, when you could instead lease the resources from infrastructure experts? Wouldn’t it make more sense to leverage Google’s existing world-class knowledge, hardware, and support? That way you can free yourself up to focus on your true competitive advantages.</p>
<p>Switching to a modern infrastructure removes so many limitations. You now have infinite room to grow. You are not going to run out of disk space or bandwidth anytime soon. You aren’t going to run out of physical space either. You no longer have to think about expanding your current data center or adding new ones. You can move things around anywhere in the world with just a few clicks. And significant infrastructure changes no longer require your staff to run around switching cables and re-racking servers.</p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about rapid spikes in demand. If you need an extra 100 servers, you can get those right now. Think about how long it would take you to purchase and install those yourself. Plus, if you decide later you no longer need them, then just stop using them and you are no longer charged. You are freed from being forced to make these huge, risky expenditures. In fact, you can even adjust your resources dynamically in real-time. That means your company can handle increased holiday traffic, without needing to purchase a bunch of extra hardware.  By modernizing your infrastructure, you remove many barriers to growth.</p>
<p>Modern infrastructure also provides new possibilities. When you don’t have to worry about storage and bandwidth restrictions, then you can start to collect and process more data. Businesses often have access to a lot of data, but most of it gets thrown away or ignored. This includes data about your customer’s purchasing habits. Data about how well your services are performing. Data about how the public’s perception of your company. Storing and processing all this data will allow you to gain critical insights and improve your company value.  With Google’s business intelligence solutions, you can efficiently extract useful information in real-time from terabytes of data spread over multiple systems. </p>
<p>Also, Google’s Machine Learning tools can use this data to generate all sorts of predictive insights. Imagine being able to dynamically adjust your prices in real-time based on factors such as costs and market demand. Or being able to accurately predict the success of a new product line before actually building it. Of course, accurate predictions require accurate data. You need to collect a lot of high-quality data in order to be able to do this. So, as you can see, when traditional limitations are no longer holding you back, you can do so much more.</p>
<p>Modernizing your infrastructure can also improve your security. You no longer have to worry about physical damage. Fires, floods, blackouts. These all become Google’s headache, not yours. Your data can have multiple copies spread all over the world, and thus you never have to worry about losing anything ever again.</p>
<p>Google also has some of the best security professionals on the planet. Cyberattacks are on the rise and information security is more important than ever. Does your company currently have the expertise to fight off attacks from all over the world? As our systems become increasingly more connected, the potential surface of attack increases.  Employees can download a virus, bring a compromised phone to work, or plug in a compromised smart device in their office. Sometimes security issues can even come from a “trusted” third-party device. Do you have the expertise and experience necessary to ensure that everything in your data center is secure and kept up-to-date? Every time data is lost or compromised, you face some potentially serious repercussions. Viruses, leaked passwords, ransomware, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Google makes it easy to encrypt everything. Both data “at rest” (sitting on a hard drive) and “in flight” (traveling across a network). They offer extra protections as well such as Multi-Factor Authentication to verify a request is legitimate. And you can set up granular permissions to ensure that your employees can access only what is needed. There is complete visibility into every change made and every access request (whether it is approved or denied). Google’s data centers are closely monitored and secured from both physical and virtual intrusions. Google builds most of its own hardware, so third parties don’t even get a chance to tamper with it. And Google employs a huge team of security professionals to constantly monitor, fix and upgrade their systems.</p>
<p>The second area of focus is on modernizing your business platforms. Business platforms are built to enhance communication. This can be communication between several internal platforms. Or it can be about enhancing communication between your platform and a third party. Once your infrastructure lives in the cloud, integrating new software and services is even easier.</p>
<p>This is typically accomplished through APIs. API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs make it easy for systems to exchange information. You can use APIs to get access to new services that you yourself did not create. And you can build your own APIs to share your services with others. A good API will allow one party to securely submit a request and get a response. This could be for almost any kind of a service. There are APIs for charging credit cards, APIs for mapping out driving directions, and APIs for doing complicated date computations.</p>
<p>APIs can enable seamless experiences across multiple platforms. This is how you can log into GMail and still be logged in when you visit YouTube. Wouldn’t you like to learn more about your customer’s needs to deliver a more customized experience? APIs make it easier to integrate new services, collect and share information, and create robust and scalable systems. A modern business platform is much more flexible and scalable. It gives you the ability to add complex new functionalities without a major overhaul.</p>
<p>The third area of focus should be on modernizing your applications. This involves shifting them from running apps locally to running in the cloud. Now you can approach this in a number of ways. First, you can simply do a “lift and shift” which means changing your apps as little as possible, but just enough to get them to work on the cloud. Once you work out all the bugs and get everything to work exactly the way it did before, then you can start to make further enhancements and slowly add cloud-specific features. Second, you could follow a “brownfield” approach and completely rewrite your applications from scratch. But this time you design them to be cloud-ready from the beginning. This will increase the amount of time it takes to move over to the cloud, but should provide a much cleaner experience. Of course, if your existing applications need to be completely retired, you can always create brand new one’s using a “greenfield” approach. Your on-prem applications will be kept in place, and then retired once the new, cloud-optimized versions are ready to go live. Of course, if you don’t want to modify your applications at all, you could simply build a virtual environment in the cloud to match your existing environment and deploy your apps there instead.</p>
<p>Once you have modernized your applications, they are no longer bound by the limitations of legacy infrastructure. Your developers can focus more on adding features, instead of bypassing roadblocks. And by leveraging the development tools on GCP, it is easier and faster to build, test and deploy new changes without impacting your users or interfering with other systems. This results in less risk and more frequent updates.</p>
<p>Your developers and testers are often hamstrung in what they can do, because they have limited access to resources. Testing should ideally be done outside of production, but in an environment that looks and acts almost identical. But how many companies can afford to have a complete copy of production sitting around idle most of the time? Your developers need ways to experiment and try different ideas. But this often requires extra hardware, software, and permissions that are not available. What kind of budget can you afford to allocate to a dedicated lab environment? </p>
<p>In the cloud, this is a much easier problem to solve. You can create temporary copies of different environments that will run completely separately. Your testers can test and your developers can troubleshoot and experiment. And when they are done, you shut everything down. You don’t need to purchase any dedicated hardware. Just use what you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>Rolling out updates on the cloud is made much easier as well. You can automate your deployments so that any new change can be immediately tested. A Continuous Deployment&#x2F;Continuous Integration pipeline will make sure you identify bugs right away. Instead of making a few large, risky updates every year, you can make lots of smaller, safer ones. This means fixes and improvements get pushed out quicker. If a feature is ready now, then deploy it! Debugging is easier because less code has been modified. And reverting “bad” changes is much simpler and less impactful.</p>
<p>A complete digital transformation (that modernizes your infrastructure, your business platforms, and your applications) can completely revolutionize the way you do business.</p>
<h1 id="Cost-of-Modernization"><a href="#Cost-of-Modernization" class="headerlink" title="Cost of Modernization"></a>Cost of Modernization</h1><p>Every change comes with a cost. And digital transformation is no different. Moving your business platforms and applications over to new infrastructure will take some time and effort. Before you take this step, you will probably want to do a basic cost-benefit analysis. However, because the cloud works so differently, a straightforward comparison can be tricky. Shifting to the cloud means moving away from capital expenditures and moving towards more operational expenditures. </p>
<p>For someone used to traditional budgeting, this can actually make things easier once you get used to it. You no longer need to make a bunch of expensive purchases upfront. You can start out small and add more later when needed. You just have to pay for what you use. Once you get used to the idea, it’s really quite freeing.</p>
<p>Normally, a new department will have to spend a significant amount of resources to build up their technology and expertise. Large companies traditionally have had a huge advantage over their smaller competitors. However, cloud resources means that even the smallest organization can use the same tools and tech as everyone else. You don’t need to sink millions of dollars and years of time to level the playing field.</p>
<p>Now, getting back to price differences, you need to make sure you are not comparing “apples to oranges”. That’s why when you compare traditional on-premises hosting to the cloud, it is important to consider the TCO (or total cost of ownership). The TCO factors in all costs: including setup, maintenance, upgrades, and security. </p>
<p>Let me give you an example. Let’s say you are starting a brand new project and you need some servers for a website. You need to choose between purchasing physical machines or provisioning some VMs on Google Cloud Platform. A very common mistake would be to compare the Google Pricing Estimate for the VMs to a purchase order cost of the equivalent server hardware. This is a mistake, because it completely ignores a lot of extra “hidden costs”. </p>
<p>Server rooms are expensive. You need to think about the cost of space. You need to consider about how much power, and cooling will be required. What about physical security? What about all the networking gear you will need to connect everything? And don’t forget about redundancy. If something breaks you need some spares lying around so you can quickly fix the issue. In fact, you might need a whole spare data center in case your first one has problems. On top of this, you are going to have to hire a team of people to actually assemble and maintain everything. Basically, you are on the hook for every single detail.</p>
<p>And this is just the initial setup. You have to consider long-term effects as well. What if you need to rapidly grow in the future? Can you add enough hardware and hire enough employees in time? What if you need to expand into new markets? Do you have the expertise required to build a data center in another country? A decision that makes sense today, might not make as much sense tomorrow. You need to consider every angle. Do you want to focus your time and money on building and maintaining infrastructure? Or do you want to instead focus on your core products?</p>
<p>Now, this shift away from capital expenditures towards operational expenditures does require organizational change. You can’t just transform your server room. You also need to transform your processes. You need to establish a balance between spending and value. </p>
<p>The cloud allows you to try new things out for cheap. But who gets to decide what to try? And who gets to define what success looks like? You do not want to simply leave these decisions up to a single person or department. If you leave everything up to accounting, they might deny new ventures that could grow your business. If you leave it up to engineering, they spend too much on trying new things while ignoring the rate of return. Ideally, you need to establish a partnership between your finance, technology, and business teams. All three should work together to identify potential avenues for improvement, define the criteria for success, and to evaluate which initiatives are working.</p>
<p>This is facilitated with careful tracking. With the cloud, it is easier to monitor and analyze everything going on. You can track trends over a long period of time, and then perform an investigation to determine what your next move should be. For every change, your team needs to look at how things were before, and how things performed afterwards. If the success criteria was met, then you can continue moving forward and more money can be allocated. If the criteria was not met, then you can immediately suspend the project and reallocate those resources to something else.</p>
<p>This collaboration will keep everyone accountable and will ensure there is plenty of visibility into all decisions. Any mistakes can be quickly corrected and future attempts at growth will become a lot less risky. Google also provides a number of tools that will provide detailed and accurate reports for your current costs. You can monitor your current trends and set up alerts when spending starts to get out of control. You can even predict what future bills might look like. You need to understand what is happening today, in order to make the right decisions for tomorrow.</p>
<p>When comparing the old way versus the new way, make sure you have all the information at hand. What are you actually spending now? Does that number include everything? Hardware? Software? Utilities? Security? Backups? Personnel? Does the new way offer more features and flexibility? What can you not do now that you could do in the future? Make sure you have a complete and accurate picture so that you can make the right decisions.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations, you made it through the course! Let’s quickly review everything that was covered.</p>
<p>First, I talked about the need for digital transformation. Today’s customers often have higher expectations than your legacy infrastructure can deliver. In order to stay competitive, you need the speed, scale, and flexibility that GCP offers.</p>
<p>Next, I discussed the benefits of modernization. I talked about the importance of upgrading your infrastructure, your business platforms, and your applications. You also learned about some of the new options that become available such as automation and gaining new insight.</p>
<p>And finally, I covered the costs and changes required to modernize. You will need to change some of your expectations about budgeting and planning. Your best bet is to establish a partnership between finance, technology, and business teams. That way, you can evaluate business decisions in real-time and respond quickly and appropriately to any changes in the market. </p>
<p>Well, that’s all I have for you today. Remember to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching, and make sure to check out our many other courses on Cloud Academy!</p>
