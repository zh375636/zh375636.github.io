<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Setting up a Google Cloud Platform Environment”. My name is Daniel Mease and I’ll be taking you through this course. I am a Google Cloud Platform instructor at Cloud Academy with over 20 years of software and web development experience.</p>
<p>In this course, I am going to show you how to organize your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">GCP</a> account using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">projects</a> and prepare it for development.</p>
<p>This course is intended for Google Cloud Platform Administrators or people who want to get GCP certified (eg: Associate Cloud Engineer).</p>
<p>After completing this course, you will be able to create and manage cloud projects, create and add users to projects, assign permissions to users, enable APIs for a project, and set up budgets and monitor spending.</p>
<p>The following prerequisites will be helpful for this course. Access to a GCP admin account is not strictly required, but it will be useful if you want to practice the tasks I will be demonstrating. If you didn’t already know, you can sign up for a free trial.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses is valuable to both us as trainers and our future students. If you have any criticisms or suggestions for improvement, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share those with us.</p>
<p>Please note, when this video was recorded, all course information was accurate. Google is constantly updating its products and services as part of its ongoing drive to innovate. As a result, over time, minor discrepancies may appear in the course content. Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content up to date in order to provide the best training available. </p>
<p>So, if you notice any information that is outdated, please contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. This will allow us to make all necessary fixes to the course during its next release cycle.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-Projects"><a href="#Creating-Projects" class="headerlink" title="Creating Projects"></a>Creating Projects</h1><p>Before you can start building anything on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, you first need a project. Projects allow you to easily organize all the resources in your account. Every time you create a compute, storage or network resource, you will need to assign it to a project. Projects also contain their own unique set of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a>, APIs, and billing account information.</p>
<p>So let’s say you wanted to build a blog for sharing photos. You would start out by creating a new project. Let’s say you named it “Photo blog”. You then would start adding some resources to it. First, you might add a Compute Engine instance for running WordPress. Then a Cloud SQL database for storing your posts. And finally a Cloud Storage bucket for hosting the photos. All three of these resources would be linked to the project “Photo blog”. Other projects would be set up in a similar fashion. In this way, you can easily tell which of your resources belong to “Photo blog” and which belong to other projects.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out, creating projects might feel like an unnecessary step. However, the value quickly becomes apparent as you start building more and more. Organizing your resources into projects means that you won’t have to scroll through a thousand Virtual Machines to find the one you are looking for. Also, it means that you won’t accidentally get a production database confused with a development database. Finally, it will make your life easier when you need to shut down a project. You won’t have to track down each individual resource and manually delete it. When you delete a project, all associated resources are deleted as well.</p>
<p>And that is just a few. There are many other advantages. For example, security is greatly enhanced. Just because one project has access to an API, does not mean all your projects need access. The same is true for users. Not every user account needs the same level of permissions to every project. If you are going to be building anything substantial, you really need to get comfortable with creating and organizing Google Cloud Projects.</p>
<p>So now that you understand the importance of projects, let me demonstrate how to work with them in the GCP console. It’s actually pretty simple. If you want to try to follow along, you will need admin access to a GCP account. Remember, you can always sign up for a free trial at cloud.google.com.</p>
<p>Once you first log in, your screen should look similar to this. If you just created your account, then a default project has already been set up for you. It’s called “My First Project”. You can use this project, but eventually, you will want more. So let’s go through the process of creating a new project.</p>
<p>The console usually has multiple ways of accomplishing the same goal. For example, here you could click on the project selector drop-down menu at the top of the screen. And then you can click on the “New Project” button here. Or you can also go to the Navigation menu, click “IAM &amp; Admin”, and then on “Manage Resources”. From here you can see all of your projects. You might see more or less here, depending on if this is a new account or if not. I just created this account and have not defined any organizations, so it’s mostly empty except for the one default project. </p>
<p>The obvious next step is to click the “Create Project” button. Now I need to pick a project name. This can be whatever you want. Usually, I try to pick a name that describes what I am planning to build. For this example, let’s go with “Photo Blog”.</p>
<p>When you create a new project, a Project ID is automatically generated for you based upon the Project Name. Usually, it will contain the name of the project and have a random number appended to the end. The Project Name is purely for your benefit. It can be whatever you want. You can change it at any time. And it does not need to be unique. </p>
<p>The Project ID is for uniquely identifying your project. This allows GCP to distinguish your project from all others. That also means your Project ID needs to be globally unique. The ID cannot be the same as any other projects in any other account. You can see that it is possible to try to pick your own ID, but generally, I would recommend against it. It’s going to be hard to pick something clever that has not already been used by someone else. Instead, pick a good name and let Google generate the ID for you.</p>
<p>You are also asked to pick a location. If you have a more complicated setup with folders or multiple organizations, you will need to pick the correct one. But since this is a new, personal account I don’t have any of that. I will just leave it set to the default.</p>
<p>Once I click “Create”, the project will be created.</p>
<p>After creating a project, you can view the details on the Project info card on the Dashboard. You also can switch between projects by clicking on the project selector drop-down at the top of the page. Now that I have switched to the “Photo blog” project, anything I build will be assigned to that project.</p>
<p>When you no longer have use for a project, you can delete it. A project is marked for deletion for 30 days before it is actually deleted. This gives you some time to recover a project if you accidentally deleted it, or if you change your mind later. While the project is marked for deletion, it is unusable; however, its resources still count against your project quota until it is deleted. If a billing account is assigned to the project, the project may not be deleted until the current billing cycle ends.</p>
<p>To shut down a project, open the Nav menu, click on “IAM and Admin”, then click “Manage Resources”. Then simply select the Project and click the “Delete” button at the top of the page. Then you will get a confirmation warning about deleting a project. To confirm deleting, enter the Project ID. And finally, click the “Shut down” button. Be aware that deleting a project will not allow you to reuse the same Project ID. Once you use a project ID, that ID can never be used again by anyone.</p>
<p>A deleted project can be restored, as long as you do it before the end of the 30-day shutdown period. To restore a project, simply click on the “Resources Pending Deletion” button. Find the deleted project or projects that you want to restore, and select them. Then click the “Restore” link at the top of the page. And finally, confirm that you wish to restore the project by clicking the “Restore” button. So if we go back, we can confirm that the project is no longer marked for deletion.</p>
<p>So now you know how to create, delete and restore cloud projects. If you have access to a GCP account, you may want to try creating and deleting a few projects yourself to get familiar with the process.</p>
<h1 id="Adding-Users"><a href="#Adding-Users" class="headerlink" title="Adding Users"></a>Adding Users</h1><p>Typically, companies will have many different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">projects</a> with many different users working on them. And those users will often have different needs. For example, some users might need access to every project, while others might only need to access one or two. Some users will just need the ability to just look at things, while others might also need to make changes. That is why every project in your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a> account has its own set of users. And each user account can have its own unique set of permissions.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating new user accounts, you have a couple of options. First, you can manually create them yourself. This works fine if you have a small number of users. However, for large companies with hundreds or thousands of users, you may want to consider automating the process.  If you already have something like Active Directory or LDAP, you can use Google Cloud Directory Sync to automatically replicate them to Google Cloud Identity. Cloud Identity allows you to manage and authorize your user accounts across multiple applications and projects. It also supports SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), as well as two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose, you have full control over which permissions are granted to your users. This is accomplished by assigning roles. Roles are groups of permissions. You could try to directly assign individual permissions to users, but this would take a lot of time. Users typically need many, many different types of permissions to do their jobs. So to save time, you instead assign permissions to roles. And then you assign roles to users. </p>
<p>Now there are three main types of roles: basic, predefined, and custom. Basic and predefined roles are already created for you by Google. Custom roles are roles that you can create yourself.</p>
<p>Basic roles (formerly called primitive roles) represent a very simple and broad set of permissions. The Browser role allows a user to view what resources already exist, but not get any detailed information. The Viewer role allows a user to get more detailed information about resources, but not modify them. The Editor role allows a user to modify resources, but not other user accounts. And the Owner role gives a user full control. Owners can modify any resource or user account, and can also do things like set up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">billing</a>. It is generally recommended that you avoid using basic roles, especially in production <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">environments</a>. Basic roles typically either grant too many or not enough permissions.</p>
<p>Predefined roles provide smaller sets of permissions for specific resources. And because of this, there are many, many more predefined roles than basic ones. For example, if a user needed to be able to inventory all the compute engine resources, you could grant them the “Compute Viewer” predefined role. This would only allow them to view the current Compute Resources. If a user needed to modify firewall rules, you could grant them the “Compute Security Admin” predefined role. And if a user needed full control over all Compute Engine resources including VMs, security, and storage, you could grant them the “Compute Admin” predefined role.</p>
<p>The third type of role is the custom role. Custom roles are groups of permissions that can be as wide or as restricted as you wish. Predefined roles cover many typical scenarios, but can still end up granting unnecessary permissions. By defining your own Custom roles, you can assign exactly the permissions each user needs and no more.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough talk. Time to demonstrate how to create user accounts and assign roles. First, go to the Navigation menu and select “IAM &amp; Admin” and then “IAM”. Right now I just have a single user account for myself. This is the account I am using right now. Let’s add a few more.</p>
<p>Before creating a new user, always double-check that you have the right project selected. You don’t want to accidentally add a user to the wrong project. </p>
<p>Next, click the “Add” button at the top of the page. First, you will need to enter the user’s email address. So let me do that. Second, you need to pick at least one role to assign. There are the three main types of roles I talked about before. You can find Basic roles here. For this first user I will pick “Browser”. And once you click on “Save” the user will be created. So now the person with the email address of newuser1@gmail can log in and browse the resources inside of my “Photo blog” project.</p>
<p>Next, let’s add another user with some predefined roles. I will enter another email address. You can find the predefined roles down here under “All roles”. You can see that there are a lot more predefined roles than basic. There are so many, that it is often helpful to use the filter to search for the roles you are interested in. I can search for “App Engine” and get a list of App Engine related roles. So let me assign the App Engine Viewer role. You can also add more roles. You aren’t just limited to one. So let me add another predefined role. I’ll pick “BigQuery Data Viewer”. And then click “Save”.</p>
<p>So I have assigned basic and predefined roles. Let’s create a third user and assign custom roles. I have already created a few custom roles before I started filming so you could see how this work. If you want to create a new role, you can click on the “Manage Roles” link below. I’m going to assign Custom Role 1.  And also Custom Role 2. So now you know how to add new user accounts to your project. </p>
<p>Really quickly, I want to also show you how to create your own custom roles. If you select “Roles” from the side menu, you will see a list of the predefined and custom roles that exist. From here you just need to click on “Create Role” at the top of the page and you can pick a title (which is the name) and then add permissions. There are a lot of permissions to choose from, so you can also search and filter by name. I am just going to pick a few permissions at random.</p>
<p>So this new custom role is called “Custom Role 3”. It is going to have 4 assigned permissions. And once I click “Create” it will be available to use.</p>
<p>There are going to be times when you want to delete a user.  Luckily, deleting is pretty simple. Let’s go back to the IAM page. You just select the users, and then click the “Remove” button at the top of the page. Confirm that, yes, you wish to remove the users from the project. And that is all there is to it. The user accounts have been deleted.</p>
<p>As you can see, creating users and assigning them roles is fairly straightforward. The real trick is understanding what permissions your users will need. It depends on what you are building and what your requirements are. Remember, you can always change permissions later. So it is recommended to start out assigning the minimum amount of permissions at first. Then you can add more later as required. It is safer to give out too few, than too many.</p>
<p>And that wraps up the lesson on users and roles. If you can, I recommend creating a few users with different levels of permissions. Then try to log in as each and take note of the limitations on what you can see and do. </p>
<h1 id="Enabling-APIs"><a href="#Enabling-APIs" class="headerlink" title="Enabling APIs"></a>Enabling APIs</h1><p>In order to access certain Google Cloud resources, you may need to enable the corresponding API. Google Cloud APIs are application programming interfaces that give you access to certain Google Cloud services. APIs for common tasks are enabled by default. But many APIs are disabled and need to be explicitly enabled for your project before you can start using them.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing an application that interacts with a user’s Google Calendar. In order to add or modify events, you would need to enable the Google Calendar API. You can find a complete list of all APIs at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/apis">https://cloud.google.com/apis</a>. When you enable an API, the corresponding monitoring pages and billing properties are also added to your project.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate how to enable an API for a project. First, verify that you have the correct project selected in the drop down. Then go to the navigation menu and select “APIs &amp; Services” and “Dashboard”. This will show you all your currently enabled APIs. If you want to add a new one, click the “Enable APIs and Services” button at the top of the page. You can browse the list or search for the name. I’ll just pick the “Google Calendar API”. And then click the enable button. </p>
<p>Now some APIs require more than just enabling them. You might need to do some extra steps. For example, some will ask you to accept their terms of service. Others may require additional signup. Like here, I need to create some credentials to get it fully working. But we can verify that the API was enabled by going back to the Dashboard. And here we can see that the Google Calendar API has been enabled. </p>
<p>When you no longer have use for an API, you can disable it as well. To disable an API for your project, select the API. Then click the “Disable API” link at the top of the page. We can confirm it was disabled by double checking the dashboard. And there you go. The Google Calendar API is no longer listed.</p>
<p>Remember that you only want to enable the APIs you actually need in the projects that will use them. When an API is disabled, you can’t accidentally use it and avoid wasting money.</p>
<h1 id="Manage-Billing"><a href="#Manage-Billing" class="headerlink" title="Manage Billing"></a>Manage Billing</h1><p>Using Google Cloud Platform costs money. At the time of this recording, signing up for a free trial gets you $300 worth of credit for up to 90 days. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google</a> also has a free tier which gives you limited access to some GCP services as well. This free trial and free tier should provide enough to experiment with and learn, but eventually, you will need to start paying. This becomes especially true once you begin building and deploying production-ready workloads.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is important to understand how to set up billing, monitor your spending, and get detailed information on any charges. I will cover all of that in this lesson.</p>
<p>First, let me demonstrate how to add a new billing account to a project. Now if you signed up for an account, you already set up a billing by providing a credit card. But sometimes you will want to have your projects use different billing accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s start by clicking on “Billing” in the Nav menu. Then open the drop down and click on ”Manage billing accounts”. You can see my current billing account. I want to create a new one, so I will click on “Create Account”. You need to assign a name. Then select a country. This determines the currency you will be charged in. Now review the information in payments profile. It suggests using the credit card I previously entered. But I want to enter a different one, It already has my name and billing address, so I don’t need to add those. Finally, click “Submit and Enable Billing”.  And you can see that I now have two billing accounts, instead of just one.</p>
<p>Next, I want to link my new billing account to one of my projects. Click on “Account Management” to view the projects that are currently linked to your billing account. Since this is the new account, no projects are listed. I need to select the old account, to see my current projects. Now I can modify my “Photo blog” project to use the new billing account. Let me jump back to the new billing account. And we confirm that “Photo blog” is linked to it.</p>
<p>You can also disable billing. To disable billing for a project, click the Actions button to the right of the project you want to change. Then select “Disable billing”. And confirm by clicking the “Disable Billing” button. When you disable billing it simply stops automatic payments. You are still responsible for all outstanding charges for the project. So if you want to make sure you do not receive any more charges, you should also delete the project.</p>
<p>So now that you understand how to manage billing accounts, let’s cover setting a budget. Setting a budget does not create a hard cap on spending. You can still spend more than what the budget allows. Think about it. You would NOT want a production system to suddenly shut down because it exceeded it’s budget. Budgets are used for generating alerts when costs begin to rise. If you want to actually stop spending, you will need to delete the project.</p>
<p>To create a budget for a project, from the Billing page, click on “Budgets and alerts”. Then click on “Create Budget”. You will need to give your new budget a name. Then select the scope for your budget to cover. In this case, I will leave it set to “All services”. You can also tell it to filter out any discounts or promotions if you wish.</p>
<p>Next, you specify the amount of your budget. For this example, I will pick $100 because it is a nice round number.</p>
<p>Under actions, you define how and when you will be notified. By default, administrators and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">users</a> with billing account roles will receive email alerts when the amount spent exceeds 50%, 90%, and 100% of the budget. You can change or add more thresholds if you wish. Let me add a new notification at 25%. Remember, the budget won’t actually cap your spending. Once you receive a notification, it is up to you to decide what to do.</p>
<p>You also can choose how you want to be notified. You can send emails or you can publish a message to a Pub&#x2F;Sub topic.</p>
<p>Click the Finish button and your budget will be set. Now I will get my first notification email when my spend exceeds $25. If you are using a free trial, you may want to create an alert so you do not end up getting an unexpected bill at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll show you how to generate a billing export for a project. Billing exports are detailed copies of your charges that live inside a BigQuery database. Once you have your charges in a database, you can easily filter and sort the details. You can also use DataStudio to create charts and graphs to generate reports.</p>
<p>To create a billing export, select “Billing export” from the Billing page. From here you can choose between the different types. I can pick either to export all my costs, or I can export any price changes. For this example, I want a full list of all my costs, so I’ll pick the first option.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll confirm the project I want to perform the export on. And then I have to pick a BigQuery table to export to. I do not have any BigQuery tables set up, so I will choose “Create New Dataset”. Now I have to pick a name for the new table. This must only include letters, numbers and underscores. Then I can pick where the data will reside. If you want, you can set an expiration date for the table. And finally, you can pick an encryption method. I do not want anything fancy, so I am going to stick with the defaults. Click the “Create Dataset” to confirm.</p>
<p>I can confirm that the new table has been created by clicking on the Dataset name. Now if I want, I can use BigQuery to view my bill details. I’m not going to actually demonstrate that, since using BigQuery is out of scope. If you understand how to write SQL queries, you shouldn’t have too much trouble accessing this information yourself.</p>
<p>So that’s it. You know the basics for managing billing on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/introduction/">how to set up a Google Cloud Platform environment</a>. Let’s do a quick review. </p>
<p>First, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/creating-projects/">create and delete projects</a>. You will use projects to manage and organize your GCP account.</p>
<p>Second, I showed you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/adding-users/">create user accounts</a> and to assign them permissions via roles. You should try to remember the three types of roles: Basic, Predefined, and Custom. Basic roles include the Browser, Viewer, Editor, and Owner roles. Basic roles are simple to use and understand, but not very secure to use in any sort of real environment. Predefined roles are more granular and are broken up into smaller groups of permissions. If a predefined role matches your need, use that. Otherwise, you can create your own custom roles for when you need something special. It is highly recommended that you avoid using basic roles, and choose predefined or custom roles instead.</p>
<p>Third, we covered enabling APIs to give you access to different Google services. These services include all kinds of things, including compute, storage, networking, and many more. You can control which resources a project has access to by enabling or disabling the associated API.</p>
<p>Fourth, I showed you how to add a billing account. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/setting-up-google-cloud-platform-environment-1697/manage-billing/">Billing accounts</a> allow you to specify how you will pay for the services consumed in each project. Projects can share the same billing account, or can have different accounts, depending upon your needs. You can set up spending alerts for a project by setting a budget. And you analyze your spending habits by performing a billing export.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the GCP Resource Manager documentation and trying out some of the “How-to guides” at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager">https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager</a>.</p>
