<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this course where I shall be looking at how to manage your User identities when using the AWS Identity and Access Management Service, commonly referred to as IAM. I shall be looking at Users in depth, so if you are new to IAM and are looking to secure your resources through identity-based management then keep watching!</p>
<p>My name is Stuart Scott, and I am the AWS Content Director here at Cloud Academy. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen, alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The information set out in this course has been designed for those who may be in one of the following roles: an AWS Administrator, Security Engineer, Security Architect, and anyone who is looking to increase their knowledge of the IAM service in preparation for an AWS Certification. By the end of this course you will have a greater understanding of Users within IAM, how to create, manage, and configure them using security best practices. As an intermediate course, you should already have a basic understanding of AWS IAM and what the service is used for. It would also be advantageous if you had some basic hands-on experience of AWS and some of it’s core services, but it is not essential.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both of us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you could contact <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>.

<h1 id="Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard"><a href="#Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="Overview of the User Dashboard"></a>Overview of the User Dashboard</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I’m going to review the dashboard of the user Console. In IAM, we can create user objects to represent an identity with long-term credentials, this could be a real person within your organization who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment, or it could be an account to be used by an application that may require permissions to access your AWS resources programmatically. Users are simply objects representing an identity which are used to authenticate to your AWS account with an associated set of permissions.</p>
<p>When you open the AWS IAM dashboard and select users, you will be presented with a screen similar to the following. This screen provides a summary of the key points of interest relating to your IAM users and it can quickly help you identify any potential security risks that you might encounter. As we can see, we have a number of different warnings on this screen in different colors. We have a green tick which symbolizes activity was measured within the last 90 days An amber exclamation mark showing activity was last measured between 91 and 365 days ago. And a red exclamation mark, which highlight anything older than 365 days ago. Anything either amber or red should be looked at and addressed as a priority to reduce potential security issues.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at this table and its columns to understand exactly what it’s trying to show you. The complete list of field names are shown here, and you can toggle them on an off as you need. Let me go through each of them one-by-one to explain what they represent. So username. This column is self-explanatory, it provides the username of that user.</p>
<p>Path. If you create your users using the IAM API or the AWS Command Line Interface, the CLI, then you can specify a path structure for your users. This is useful when you have a large organization and you want to define a management structure to help you organize your users more effectively.</p>
<p>For example, you could add a path for a user Stuart of &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Stuart. This would help to define where your users might be in accordance with your organization structure. In addition to this, you can also reference paths in your access policies, so for example you could allow all users in the &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F; path to have full access to S3 with a simple policy like this.</p>
<p>Groups. This shows the different groups that the user belongs to. In the screenshot, you can see that the user Stuart belongs to the Admin group. Last activity. This column is really useful to show the last time your users logged into the AWS Management Console or if they accessed any of your AWS resources programmatically using their access keys. As we can see from my example, the user Alice hasn’t accessed anything for 467 days, as a result I can say with some confidence that this user can be removed and deleted from IAM. So it’s a great way to ensure that you don’t have any unused user accounts, and deleting unused accounts is an IAM best practice.</p>
<p>MFA. MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, and so this will highlight any users that have been configured with MFA which adds an additional level of verification, enhancing security. The users in my example that show virtual mean that these users are using MFA on a virtual device, and in this example it’s the Google Authenticator app on a mobile phone. For those unfamiliar with MFA, let me give a brief explanation of what it is. Typically, when a user logs into the AWS Management Console, they will authenticate to your AWS account by providing their identification, typically their username, and then verify this identification, usually with a password. These two elements, the identification and verification, allow the user to authenticate. For many cases, the verification, the password, is sufficient enough to confirm the identity, the username. However, for users who have an elevated level of privileges, for example the users may have full access to a large number of AWS services, then you may want to, or be required to due to governance controls, implement an additional verification step within the authentication process. This adds another layer of security attached to the identity, and this is where Multi-Factor Authentication comes in, MFA. The name explains itself, it’s used to create an additional factor for authentication in addition to your existing methods, such as a password. Therefore creating a multi-factor level of authentication. So what is this additional level of security that MFA brings with AWS? MFA utilizes a random six-digit number that is only available for a very short time period before the number changes again which is generated by an MFA device. There is no additional charge for this level of authentication, however, you will need your own MFA device, which can be a physical token or a virtual device. AWS provides a summary of all supported devices here. Personally, I use Google Authenticator on my phone because it is simple and easy to set up and configure. Password age. This shows how long ago it was until the password of the user was changed. As a security best practice, your passwords should be changed regularly.</p>
<p>Console last sign-in. This column simply shows the last time a user signed in to the management console.</p>
<p>Access key ID. The access key ID will identify if it’s active or inactive and will display the key in use. Before I continue, let me just quickly explain a little more about Access Keys. Access Keys are used for programmatic access to your AWS resources, and they are comprised of two elements. An access key ID and a Secret Access Key ID The Access Key ID is made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters, such as the one shown here. The Secret Access Key ID is made up of 40 random upper and lowercase alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters, such as the one displayed on the screen. During the creation of a user who requires programmatic access, you are prompted to download and save these details and it’ll only be displayed once, and if you lose it, then you will have to delete the associated Access Key ID and recreate new keys for the user. It’s not possible to retrieve lost Secret Access Key IDs as AWS does not retain copies. These access keys must then be applied and associated with the application that you are using that requires the relevant access. For example, if you were using the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, you would first have to instruct the AWS CLI to use these Access Keys to authenticate you providing authorization. The method of performing this association varies based on the application and system that you are using. However, once this association has taken place it ensures that all API requests made to AWS are signed with this digital signature.</p>
<p>Active key age. The active key age refers to the age of the access keys that are associated with the user which, as I explained, are required for programmatic access. Access key last used. This column just shows the last time that the user used their Access Keys within your AWS account. As a security best practice, it’s a good idea to remove any access keys that haven’t been used for quite some time. This removes possible entry points for malicious users to gain access to your environment.</p>
<p>The ARN. The ARN, or Amazon Resource Name provides the unique identifier for referencing that particular user. For example, the one showne here for the user Stuart. Creation time. This is a simple time metric to show you how long ago the user was created Console access. The console access helps you to determine which users have access to the Management console. When creating a new user, you have the option to configure their access type as seen here. Each user can be configured to have Programmatic Access, or AWS Management Console Access, or both. If they have access to the Console, then this column will show as Enabled for the user and Disabled if the user does not have console access.</p>
<p>Signing certs. Finally, the last column of signing certs will show if the user has a Signing Certificate or X.509 Certificate associated with them for secure access to certain AWS product interfaces. For example, EC2 uses a Signing Certificate for access to its SOAP, Simple Object Access Protocol, and command line utilities. Finally, before we finish this lecture, you can also create and delete users as required, and search for any of your users via their username or access key from within the user dashboard.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-IAM-Users"><a href="#Creating-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Creating IAM Users"></a>Creating IAM Users</h1><p>When creating a new user, you have the option to create it via the AWS Management Console or programmatically via the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or using the IAM HTTP API. For this lecture, I should be using the AWS Management Console to demonstrate how to configure Users. User object creation is a simple process. Firstly, you will set the user details by creating a username, which can be up to 64 characters in length. Next you’ll select the AWS access type, either AWS Management Console access or programmatic access.</p>
<p>For programmatic access, an access key ID and secret access key ID will be issued to be used with the AWS CLI, SDKs or other development tools. If console access is required, you will need to define a console password for the user. Permission assignment through the use of policies can be attached to the user or inherited from a group that the user can be assigned to. And permission boundaries can also be applied to the user, controlling their maximum permission level. You can assign any tags to the user as you would with any other AWS resource. And then you must review and confirm the information that has been submitted before you create the user.</p>
<p>Once the user is created, you can download the security credentials via a CSV file. And that will contain the username, access keys required for programmatic access and the console login link. So let me now jump into the console to demonstrate how to create a new user. Okay, so I’ve just logged into my AWS Management Console. And the first thing I want to do is to go to IAM. And that can be found under the Security, Identity and Compliance category.</p>
<p>So if we select IAM, and that will take us straight to the IAM dashboard. And this is where we can start creating our users and groups and roles, et cetera, and anything else that we need to manage within IAM. So to create a new user, I need to go across to Users on the left here. And then from here, I can select Add users.</p>
<p>Now the first thing I need to do is to create the username of the user. So I’m going to call this user Patricia. And then we can select the access types. So we have the programmatic access here, all the AWS Management Console access here. So for this user, let me add both. So I want them to have programmatic access and also AWS Management Console access. So I’m going to select both. So for the AWS Management Console access, we need to enable a password so we can either have IAM auto-generated password or I can select my own. And for this demonstration, I’m going to add in my own password.</p>
<p>Now if you tick this option here, when the user signs in, they will be asked to generate their own password once they’ve used your initial password to login. And that’s a great idea, just to enhance security there. So if we click on Next, then we can assign permissions. And here we have a couple of options so we can add the user to an existing group. We can copy permissions from another user or attach existing policies directly to the user. So for best practice, I’m just going to add this user to a couple of different groups. So I’m gonna add them to the CloudAcademy group, and also to the RDSFullAccess.</p>
<p>So once you’ve selected the groups that you want the user to have, you can click on Next to go to tags. And this is an optional step. You can add any key value tags here for that user if you want to. Just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Then if we go to Next to Review, then we can review all the options that we’ve set. So we’ve given the username. We specify the access types. So you’ve got programmatic and AWS Management Console access. We’ve not set any permission boundaries. We’ve added the groups that we want the user to belong to and we haven’t applied any tags.</p>
<p>So now, we can go to Create User. Now we’ve successfully created the IAM user, but because we specified that we wanted programmatic access, we need to copy the access key ID and also the secret access key ID as well. If we download the CSV file of that user and take a look at that, we can see here that this CSV file shows the access key ID and also the secret access key ID, and also the console link as well to allow that user to login. So if we go back to the AWS Console, we can also email those login instructions to the user as well if we need to. Once you’ve taken a copy of the access key ID and the secret access key, then you can close this window. Remember, you will only be given one opportunity to take these details and download the CSV that contains that information, so make sure you do that. Then click on Close. And we can now see that that user, Patricia, has been set up as a user with the CloudAcademy and RDSFullAccess groups. So it’s very simple. It’s very quick. It’s very easy to set up a new user within IAM.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-IAM-Users"><a href="#Managing-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Managing IAM Users"></a>Managing IAM Users</h1><p>Once you have created IAM users, you can view their details to configure additional security options or review permissions and change access. In this lecture, I want to cover these additional features. This will be easiest to explain via a demonstration, and I can explain each point as we go through, so let’s take a look. So in this demonstration, I just want to select a user and just to show you some of the different elements that you can change of that user once it has been created, so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>So I’m in the Identity and Access Management Dashboard at the moment and you can see I’m in the Users section. So let’s take a look at this user, Patricia. So if I select the user and we can have a look at some of the options that we can see about this user and some of the things that we can change, et cetera. So this is a summary screen of the user. We have the users ARN at the top here, and we can also see the creation time of that user. And then we have a number of different tabs.</p>
<p>So start with the permissions tab. We can see that this user is getting permissions from two policies at the moment here, the Amazon S3 Full Access policy, and also the Amazon RDS Full Access. And if we wanted to, we can just take a quick look at these groups. We can have a look at the policy summary, or we can take a look at the JSON as well. So that’s the policy and the JSON format. And then if we look at the policy summary, we can see here that this allows full access to S3 and S3 Object Lambda. Here we can set her permissions boundary. Currently there’s not one set, but if we wanted to, we can set one to control the maximum permissions that this user can have. And also there’s a feature here to generate policy based on CloudTrail events.</p>
<p>So what this will do, it will generate a policy looking at the user’s activity. And then based on what the user has been accessing, it can generate a policy based on what services this user has been accessing. Also at the top here, we can add an inline policy for this user. So if we’d done that, then that will be a policy that is embedded within the user object itself. So it’s not taken from a role, it’s not taken from a group. The policy is attached within the user.</p>
<p>Okay, if we take a look at the groups, we can just see a quick breakdown of any groups that the user belongs to, and the policies that are attached to them, which we covered just a moment ago in the summary. The tags is what you’d expect. If there’s any tags here for the user, then they would be listed, or if you wanted to add any tags, then you can do so here. So for example, we can add a key of location and say, UK, Save Changes. And then we can see this tag for this user. Under security credentials, we could see console link that this user can use and we can manage the user’s password. And if we want to change the password, we can simply click on manage, and we can either disable the console access or generate a new password, or ask the user to create a new password at the next sign-in. We also have here, the assigned MFA device, the multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s not assigned, but we can go ahead and set up MFA for this user. So let’s go ahead and do that quickly. So if we click on manage, we have a couple of options here, virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or another hardware MFA device. For this, I’m just going to use a virtual MFA device and I’ll use the Google Authenticator app on my phone to do this. If I click on continue. So, first of all, you need to make sure you have an app on your mobile phone or your computer. Like I say, I’m going to use the Google Authenticator app on my phone.</p>
<p>So what I need to do is to show the QR code, and now on my phone, I’m going to add this as a new entry in my Google Authenticator app, so I’m going to click on Scan QR code. And then we can see at the bottom there is added the user, Patricia. And then we add in that code, so 074720. And then what we need to do is to add the second code that comes in when it appears on the Google Authenticator app. So we’re just waiting for that to come around and then I can add in the second code and then it’ll be synchronized and configured. So, we can see it’s about to change, and now I can add in the next code 185887, and then I click on Assign MFA. And that’s it, so you have successfully assigned a virtual MFA device to that user. Click on Close, and there we can see here that there’s an assigned MFI device. We can see that this user also had programmatic access ‘cause there’s access keys that have been generated.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to, we can make this access key ID inactive. So if wanted to do that, simply click on Make inactive. And it’ll explained that once you’ve done this, you can’t then use these keys to form any programmatic access. Click on deactivate. And you can see here, the status is now inactive. So any access keys that were used before for this user will no longer be allowed to make any kind of requests. If we wanted to generate new access keys, simply click on Create access key. And again, you’ll have a new access key ID and a new secret access key. And if you wanted to, you can download the CSV file, so you don’t forget those keys. Click on Close.</p>
<p>Now, if we go back up to the top to Access Advisor, I just wanted to show you this quickly. So what this does, it will basically show you which services that this user can access based on their current permissions, and also the last time that these services were accessed. So if you scroll down here, we can see that this user has access to a whole different range of services. And it’ll show you which policies are actually granting these permissions.</p>
<p>So this access to EC2 in IAM is being granted through the RDS Full Access policy, and access to S3 is being granted through the Amazon S3 Full Access. So this is great to review to identify if there’s any users there that do have access to services that they probably shouldn’t do. So you can then modify the policies accordingly just to make sure that the users are only accessing what they are supposed to access. So that was a very quick demonstration of some of the key points that you can change within a user’s properties once you have created an IAM user.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>This course covered all things related to IAM users, from the user dashboard, to the creation and management of users. AWS IAM is one of those services that you need to become very familiar with as it’s a fundamental part of your security process and ties in with any security governance controls that you might need to adhere to, whether they are either internal or external. Having a solid grasp of how to manage your users in IAM will help prevent you from having unnecessary security risks and exposures within your environment.</p>
<p>IAM user management is key to maintaining secure access controls at both the programmatic and console level. You should ensure you are regularly reviewing the following. The groups that are associated with your users to ensure those user still need access to those groups. You should monitor the Last Activity to identify any users who could potentially be removed and deleted from IAM. Implement multi-factor authentication, especially for any users who have an elevated level of permission.</p>
<p>Rotate and change passwords regularly. Remove console access for those users who have not signed into it for an extended period of time. Rotate access keys on a regular basis. And remove programmatic access for users who have not used their Access Key for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of IAM users and how to create, manage and review them to maintain a secure environment. Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you can contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. Thank you for your time and good luck with your continued learning of cloud computing. Thank you.</p>
