<h1 id="Course-Introduction"><a href="#Course-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course Introduction"></a>Course Introduction</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Introduction to Azure Storage. My name is Thomas Mitchell and I’ll be taking you through this course.</p>
<p>I’m an Azure instructor at Cloud Academy and I have over 25 years of IT experience, several of those with cloud technologies. If you have any questions about this course, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or send an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#x63;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#x6d;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#x70;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#x40;&#99;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#x63;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#x6d;&#121;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>
<p>This course is intended for those who wish to learn about the basics of Microsoft Azure storage.</p>
<p>We’re going to start things off with an introduction to azure storage. You’ll learn about the core storage services in Azure and about the different storage account types that are available. You also get to see a demonstration that shows you how to create a storage account in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>We’ll then take a look at the different storage services in a little more detail. We will start with blob storage, where you will learn what it is and what it offers. Next, will dive into Azure Files.</p>
<p>After covering Azure Files, we’ll dive into Azure queues. You’ll learn what Azure queues are and how to create a queue.</p>
<p>After learning about Azure queues, you’ll learn about Azure tables, where you will learn why and when to use Azure table storage.</p>
<p>We’ll wrap things up by taking an introductory look at Azure disks. </p>
<p>By the time you finish this course, you should have a solid understanding of the storage basics of Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. If you’re ready to learn about Azure storage, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Core-Storage-Services-in-Azure"><a href="#Core-Storage-Services-in-Azure" class="headerlink" title="Core Storage Services in Azure"></a>Core Storage Services in Azure</h1><p>Hello and welcome to core storage services in Azure. In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the core storage offerings, including blob storage, Azure Files, queue storage, table storage, and disk storage. However, before we get into the separate storage services, let’s take a look at some of the benefits of Azure storage.</p>
<p>Because the Azure storage platform is designed for virtually all modern-day data storage requirements, it was built to offer several key benefits. First and foremost, all Azure storage services are durable and highly available. Built-in redundancy keeps data safe in the event of underlying hardware failures within the Azure infrastructure. In addition to this redundancy, you can also cross multiple data centers and even multiple geographical regions. This provides protection against natural disasters or local failures at the data center level.</p>
<p>Because all data that gets written to Azure storage accounts is encrypted automatically, it is inherently secure as well. Azure also offers the ability to maintain fine-grained control over data access. </p>
<p>Azure storage offerings are also scalable and widely accessible. As I mentioned earlier, the Azure storage platform is designed to support all modern-day data storage requirements. That being the case, it’s designed to be massively scalable. You can access Azure data from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. There are also numerous client libraries available for Azure storage in numerous languages. This means you can access Azure storage using things like .NET, Java, Python, PHP, and many others.</p>
<p>You can also access Azure storage through PowerShell scripting, through the Azure CLI, through the Azure portal, and through Azure Storage Explorer.</p>
<p>So now that you understand some of the key benefits of the core Azure storage services, let’s take an introductory look at each of them.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Azure blobs.</p>
<p>Azure blob storage provides object storage for the cloud. This offering has been optimized to support massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that does not fit a specific data model. For example, text and binary data would be the type of unstructured data that falls under blob storage.</p>
<p>Azure Files is essentially a fully managed file share system available in the cloud. You can access Azure Files through the typical SMB protocol. You can mount Azure file shares from Windows, Linux, and MacOS machines that reside both on-prem and in the cloud. You can even cash Azure file shares on Windows servers, using the Azure file sync service. This helps make data more accessible for remote offices.</p>
<p>Azure queue storage is a special type of storage service. It’s not meant for storing files. Instead, it’s designed for storing large numbers of messages. These messages are used in communications between the different components of a distributed application. Such messages can be accessed from anywhere in the world through authenticated calls via HTTP or HTTPS. Each queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A typical queue can contain millions of messages.</p>
<p>Azure table storage is a storage offering intended for the storage of structured NoSQL data. It offers a key&#x2F;attribute store and a schema-less design. The schema-less design of Azure table storage allows you to more easily adapt the data to the needs of your business or application.</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s take a look at Azure managed disks. Azure managed disks are essentially block-level storage volumes. These storage volumes, which are managed by Azure, are used, to provide storage capabilities for virtual machines. A managed disk is much like a physical desk that you would see in an on-prem server. However, it’s virtualized. There are several types of disks available in Azure. They include ultra disks, premium SSD disks, standard SSD disks and standard HDD disks. We will touch on these in more detail later on.</p>
<p>So, to wrap things up for this lesson, let’s review. There are essentially five different core storage services available in Microsoft Azure. They include Azure blobs, Azure Files, Azure queues, Azure tables, and Azure disks. Each of these storage services are accessed through an Azure storage account. Over the next several lessons, we will dive into storage accounts and into the details of each core storage service in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h1 id="Storage-Account-Types-in-Azure"><a href="#Storage-Account-Types-in-Azure" class="headerlink" title="Storage Account Types in Azure"></a>Storage Account Types in Azure</h1><p>Hello and welcome to storage account types in Microsoft Azure. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at the different types of storage accounts that are available when it comes time to provision storage in your Azure subscription.</p>
<p>Before we get into the different types of storage accounts. Let’s talk a little bit about what a storage account is and what it’s used for. A storage account in Azure can be viewed as the container, so to speak, that houses all of your Azure storage data objects. A storage account can host blobs, Azure Files, queues, tables, and disks.</p>
<p>When you provision a storage account. You are asked to provide a unique name for that storage account. This is necessary because data within a storage account is accessible from anywhere in the world. That being the case, the storage account namespace must be unique across the Azure landscape.</p>
<p>There are several different types of storage accounts available. Each type offers different features, and each has a different pricing model.</p>
<p>The first type of storage account is the general-purpose V2 account. A general-purpose V2 storage account is a basic storage account that can be used, to host blobs, files, queues, and tables. Microsoft recommends using the general-purpose V2 storage account for most scenarios that require Azure storage.</p>
<p>The general-purpose V1 storage account is similar to the V2 account. This legacy type account can also host blobs, files, queues, and tables. While a general-purpose V1 account offers similar functionality to the V2 accounts, Microsoft recommends using the general-purpose V2 account instead. This tells me that the general-purpose V1 storage account will probably go away at some point in the future.</p>
<p>The next type of storage account we are going to take a look at here is the block blob storage account. Block blob storage accounts offer premium performance for block blobs and append blobs. You would typically use a block blob storage account for situations where high transaction rates are in play. Block blob storage accounts are also a good choice for scenarios that require low storage latency.</p>
<p>File storage accounts are exactly what the name says they are. They are files only storage accounts. Because they feature high-performance characteristics, Microsoft recommends using these kinds of accounts for enterprise applications or for high-performing applications.</p>
<p>The last storage account type touch on here is the blob storage account. The blob storage account is a legacy account that is used for blob only storage. Microsoft actually recommends that, instead of using blob storage accounts, you use general-purpose V2 accounts. Like the general-purpose V1 accounts, I suspect the blob storage accounts, because of their legacy status, will likely go away sometime in the future.</p>
<p>The table that you see on your screen right now shows each of the different types of storage accounts, along with their key features. As you can see on your screen. Every storage account type is encrypted using storage service encryption, or SSE, for data that is at rest.</p>
<p>I should point out that archive storage and blob level tiering only support block blobs.</p>
<p>Another key point I should mention here is that zone redundant storage and Geo zone redundant storage are only available for standard general-purpose V2 accounts, block blob accounts, and file storage accounts in certain regions.</p>
<p>The premium performance that you see listed for general-purpose V2 and general-purpose V1 accounts is only available for disk storage and page blobs. Premium performance for block blobs and append blobs is only available for block blob accounts. Also, just as importantly, premium performance for files is only available on file storage accounts.</p>
<p>For more information on the different storage accounts available in Microsoft Azure, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview</a></p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-a-Storage-Account"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-a-Storage-Account" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating a Storage Account"></a>DEMO: Creating a Storage Account</h1><p>Hi everyone and welcome back. In this brief demonstration, I’m going to show you how to create a storage account using the Azure portal. Now, every storage account needs to belong to a resource group. Now a resource group, as you may know is a logical container that groups all of your Azure resources.</p>
<p>Now when we create our storage account here, we’re going to have two options, we can create a storage account and then as part of that process, we can create the new resource group or we can select an existing resource group. What we’re going to do here is add this new storage account to an existing resource group.</p>
<p>So on the screen here, I’m logged into my Azure portal and I’m at the home page. To create our general purpose V2 storage account, what we’ll do here is go up to the hamburger here and select all services. And then from here, we can search for storage accounts. And we’ll select it from the results page here. And we can see in my existing subscription here, I already have a storage account called VMLab diag 601.</p>
<p>What we’re going to do here is create a new one by clicking Add. And then from here, we need to provide some basic information, we need to specify the subscription that’s going to host the storage accounts. We need to select the resource group we want to deploy the storage account into or we can create a new one here. And then of course, we need to give our storage account a name, tell Azure which locations going into and then the performance of the storage account.</p>
<p>We can see that standard storage accounts are backed by magnetic drives and they are the cheapest cost per gigabyte. We can see in this popup, that standard storage accounts are good for applications that need bulk storage or where you’re accessing the data within that storage account infrequently. The premium storage accounts are backed by solid state drives. You use these when you need a consistent low latency performance.</p>
<p>Now you will notice here that a premium performance storage account can only be used with Azure virtual machine disks and they are best for IO intensive applications like databases. Another important item to note here is that virtual machines that use premium storage for all of their discs, do qualify for a 99.9% SLA even if they’re not running within an availability set so that’s pretty important to remember.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we’ll just use a standard storage account here and then the account kind here is where we can select what type of storage account to deploy. Here, we have three options storage V2, storage which is basically the legacy general purpose V1 and Blob storage.</p>
<p>Now in the replication dropdown, we can specify the redundancy that we need for our storage whether it be locally-redundant, zone-redundant, geo-redundant, read-access geo-redundant, geo zone-redundant or read access geo zone-redundant. Instead of going through each of these individually, you can visit the URL that you see on your screen for more information about each of these types of redundancy options. And lastly, we have the access tier here.</p>
<p>Now the hot access tier is really used for data that’s accessed frequently. The cool access tier is typically used for infrequently access data. We can also see that there is a another option and it’s the archive access tier but that can only be set at the Blob level and not on the actual storage account level.</p>
<p>So let’s go ahead and see here. We’ll deploy our storage accounts and we only have one subscription here, our labs subscription. So we’ll leave that set and then we have a couple of different resource groups here. So I’ll just deploy this into my VMLab resource group. And then we need to give our storage account a name and this name must be unique across all storage accounts in Azure, it needs to be unique across the landscape. The name can be as short as three characters but as long as 24 and it can only contain lowercase letters and numbers. So let’s call this test9878storage.</p>
<p>We get the green checkbox which means we’re good and we’ll deploy into the Central US region, that’s all we really need for this demonstration. And we’re going to deploy a general purpose V2 and we’ll accept the default read-access geo-redundant storage. We’ll do the same thing for the access tier.</p>
<p>Now, when we click Next for Networking, we can specify our network connectivity requirements, including the connectivity method and any kind of network routing or routing preferences. Now we can see here we have three options, we have a public endpoint for all networks, public end point for selected and private end points.</p>
<p>Essentially, storage accounts have a public endpoint that’s accessible through the internet. That’s what this public endpoint would be. Now, if we select public endpoint, what we do is we’re enabling that public endpoint to all networks, that’s why we have all networks here. If we select the second option here, we can see we then allow a public endpoint but then we can select which networks can access this storage account. </p>
<p>So that allows us to segment our traffic and block certain traffic. And then we have private endpoint. Now you would create a private end point to allow only private connections to this storage accounts. Now, what this would do is assign a private IP address from the virtual network that we select and it would take it and assign it to these storage accounts. And then as a result, all traffic between that virtual network and the storage account would be secured over a private link.</p>
<p>For this exercise here, we’re just going to go public and the only option we have here for routing is Microsoft network routing defaults and that’s because the combination of the storage account kind performance and replication along with location does not support internet routing which we probably wouldn’t do anyway.</p>
<p>We’ll go into data protection and then we can see, we have the Blob soft delete option, we have the file share soft delete option here and then we have versioning but versioning is not offered for this storage account due to the type of storage account combined with the subscription replication and location options.</p>
<p>So we’ll leave these at their defaults. We’ll click Next through to advanced. Now here’s where we could configure some advanced features. We could configure the secure transfer which essentially enhances the security of the storage account by only allowing the requests to that storage account by secure connections.</p>
<p>When you enable the Blob public access, the storage accounts Blobs can be read publicly without needing to share an account key or even a shared access signature. So your Blobs are wide open. We have the TLS versioning. Now this large file shares option here, turning this on provides file share support for a maximum of a hundred terabytes.</p>
<p>Now you’ll notice here that large file share storage accounts don’t have the ability to convert to geo-redundant storage offerings. And down here, we have some Data Lake Storage Gen2 options. We’ll leave these other defaults, we’ll click next for tags, we’re not going to do any tagging here. This just allows us to categorize our resources and then we’ll go ahead and click Next to Review and Create. And at this point we can see our validation has passed, we can review our configuration and then we can go ahead and click Create. And what this will do is deploy our general V2 storage account. And we can go ahead and click, Go to Resource and we are now in our test9878 storage account.</p>
<p>So that is how you walk through the process of creating a storage account in the Microsoft Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="An-Introduction-to-Blob-Storage"><a href="#An-Introduction-to-Blob-Storage" class="headerlink" title="An Introduction to Blob Storage"></a>An Introduction to Blob Storage</h1><p>Hello and welcome to blob storage. In this lesson, we are going to take a closer look at blob storage and when you should use it.</p>
<p>Azure Blob storage, as I mentioned earlier in this course, is an object storage solution in Azure. It’s optimized to allow the storage of massive amounts of unstructured data, including text and binary data.</p>
<p>You would typically use blob storage to host images and documents that you wish to serve up to a web browser. Think images on a website. Blob storage is also used when you wish to stream video or audio or to store log files. Organizations will also often use blob storage to store backup data, archive data, and data that needs to be analyzed by some on-prem process or Azure-hosted process.</p>
<p>To access objects in blob storage, you can use HTTP or HTTPS. You can also access blob storage objects through the Azure storage rest API, through Azure PowerShell, through the Azure CLI, or through an Azure storage client library such as Java, PHP, .NET, or several others.</p>
<p>There are three types of resources that you should be familiar with when discussing blob storage. They include the storage account that hosts the blob storage, containers within the storage account, and the blobs within those containers.</p>
<p>The image on your screen depicts the relationship between these resources.</p>
<p>The storage account creates the unique namespace in Azure that you use to access your data. When you access your data, you’ll use a combination of the storage account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint that you are trying to access. Together, these two pieces form the base address for the objects that reside in the storage account.</p>
<p>For example, the URL that you see on your screen would be used to access blob storage in a storage account called MyStorage:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/">http://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net</a></p>
<p>Containers within a storage account are used to organize the blobs within the account. You can view containers like directories in a file system. You can create an unlimited number of containers within a storage account, and each container can store an unlimited number of blobs.</p>
<p>There are actually three types of blobs that Azure storage supports. They include block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. Block blobs can contain up to about 190.7TiB of text and binary data. They are called block blobs because they consist of blocks of data that can be managed individually.</p>
<p>Append blobs are similar to block blobs insofar as they, too, consist of blocks of data. However, unlike block blobs, append blobs are optimized for append operations. This makes append blobs a good choice for logging data from virtual machines.</p>
<p>Page blobs are used to store random access files up to 8 TiB in size. You would typically use page blobs to store VHD files, which would serve as disks for Azure virtual machines. </p>
<p>To learn more about blob storage, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction</a> </p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Uploading-a-Block-Blob-to-Azure"><a href="#DEMO-Uploading-a-Block-Blob-to-Azure" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Uploading a Block Blob to Azure"></a>DEMO: Uploading a Block Blob to Azure</h1><p>Hello and welcome back. In this demonstration, we are going to create a container in our storage account. And then what we’re going to do is upload a block blob to that storage account. Now, before we upload our block blob to our storage account, we need to create a container.</p>
<p>The container is what will host our blob. So on the screen here, we have my test9878storage account. To create my container here, I simply select the containers chiclet here. And I can see I have no containers configured yet. So what we’ll do here, we’ll create a container.</p>
<p>Now the container name must be lowercase. So we’re gonna call it mycontainer. And we’ll create it. So now we have our container created. We can see that the default access level for that container is private. There’s no anonymous access to it. With our container created, we can upload our block blob to our storage.</p>
<p>To upload our block blob, we simply select our container and then we click upload here. And then in the right pane here, we can select the file we want to upload. And we’re just going to upload this, mytextdocument.text. And then we have an overwrite if it already exists. And then some advanced features here. None of these are required. We just get to specify what kind of authentication type, block size, the access tier and any folders we want to upload to.</p>
<p>For this demonstration, we’re just going right into the container. And then we’ll go ahead and click upload. And we can now see my text document listed in our container. We’ll close this out. And with that, we now have our container created and we were able to upload a block blob or file to our container.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to download our block blob, we simply right click it, and then we could select download here. So with that, you now know how to create a container in your blob storage and you know how to upload and download block blobs to, and from it.</p>
<h1 id="An-Introduction-to-Azure-Files"><a href="#An-Introduction-to-Azure-Files" class="headerlink" title="An Introduction to Azure Files"></a>An Introduction to Azure Files</h1><p>Hello and welcome to an intro to Azure Files. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what Azure Files is and talk a little bit about what it offers.</p>
<p>Azure Files is an offering that makes file shares available in the cloud. It’s a fully managed solution that supports access to these cloud-based file shares via the industry-standard server message block protocol, or SMB.</p>
<p>You can mount Azure file shares from cloud deployments and on-prem deployments of not only Windows machines, but also Linux, and Mac OS machines. You can also use the Azure file sync service with Azure Files to cache your Azure file shares on Windows servers that are located close to your users. By leveraging Azure file shares with Azure file sync, you can speed data access for your end users. </p>
<p>Organizations will often use Azure Files to replace on-prem file servers or to supplement them. While earlier iterations of Azure Files were not a good replacement for on-prem file servers, this is no longer the case. Because popular operating systems like Windows, Linux, and Mac OS can mount Azure file shares, Azure Files can now completely replace traditional on-prem file servers and even NAS devices. As a matter of fact, the release of Azure Files AD Authentication means Azure file share permissions can even be controlled through on-prem active directories.</p>
<p>Azure Files is also helpful when lifting and shifting applications to the cloud. This is especially true for applications that require file shares to store application data and user data.</p>
<p>Because Azure Files are fully managed, you can create as many file shares as you need without worrying about hardware management and OS installation. This means you also have no need for OS patching or security upgrades.</p>
<p>You can also use familiar PowerShell commands and Azure CLI commands to create, mount, and manage Azure file shares. They can also be created and managed through the Azure portal and through Azure Storage Explorer.</p>
<p>Because Azure Files are built to be resilient, you no longer need to worry about file server upgrades or local power outages and network issues that typically affect access to on-prem file shares.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson, where I will show you how to create an Azure file share using the Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-an-Azure-File-Share"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-an-Azure-File-Share" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating an Azure File Share"></a>DEMO: Creating an Azure File Share</h1><p>Hello and welcome back. Now, once we have a storage account created, we can go ahead and create file shares if we’re going to use the Azure file service. What I’m going to do here is show you how to create a file share within an Azure Storage account.</p>
<p>Now on the screen, you can see I’m in the storage account and I’m on the overview page. Now, from this overview page, to create a file share, I simply navigate to the file shares tab. The file shares tab allows us to see any file shares we’ve already created. And as you can see on the screen, we have none.</p>
<p>To create a new file share, we simply click the file share link here, and then we can give our file share a name and a quota. So what we’ll do here, we’ll call this file share MyShare. Now we can see the little exclamation point here and this is telling me that the file share name can only be lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. So we’ll go ahead and rename this myshare in lowercase letters.</p>
<p>Now, if I hover over the quota icon here, we can see that we can set a quota essentially up to five terabytes that limits the total size of this file share. We are not going to set a quota here, so we’ll go ahead and click create. And now we can see that our share is created and that we have the default quota. Since we didn’t specify one, it’s just giving us the entire size that’s available to us for the share.</p>
<p>If we select the share here, we can click the connect link here and this will give us information on how to connect to this share from Windows, Linux, or MacOS. We can also upload files directly to it, and we can add a directory, so let’s call this marketing, and now we have a directory within our myshare file share called marketing. So you can build a hierarchy of your file shares within your Azure portal.</p>
<p>So with that, you know how to create a file share in Microsoft Azure using the Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="An-Introduction-to-Azure-Queues"><a href="#An-Introduction-to-Azure-Queues" class="headerlink" title="An Introduction to Azure Queues"></a>An Introduction to Azure Queues</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Azure queues. In this brief lecture. We are going to take an introductory look at Azure queues and what they are used for. </p>
<p>The Azure queues storage service is designed to store large numbers of messages. Now these messages aren’t the type that you would normally think of. We’re not talking about emails or anything like that. Instead, these messages are used to facilitate communication between the components of distributed applications. When using Azure queue storage, you can access these messages from anywhere in the world through authenticated calls via HTTP or HTTPS.</p>
<p>The Azure queue service is comprised of several components. These include the URL format, a storage account, a queue, and messages.</p>
<p>To access a queue, you must do so through a specific URL format. The URL for a specific queue will include the storage account name and the queue name. For example, the URL that you see on your screen would be used to access a queue called images to process in a storage account called mystorageaccount.</p>
<p>Speaking of storage accounts, all access to virtually all Azure storage services is provided through a storage account. You can view the storage account as the overarching container that hosts your Azure storage.</p>
<p>The queue itself is actually a set of messages. When you name a queue, you must use all lowercase letters.</p>
<p>And last but not least we have messages. Messages in any format can be up to 64 kB. As I mentioned previously, these messages are used to facilitate communication between the different components of a distributed application.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson where I will show you how to create a queue in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-a-Queue"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-a-Queue" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating a Queue"></a>DEMO: Creating a Queue</h1><p>Welcome back. In this quick demonstration, I want to show you how to create a queue in Microsoft Azure using the Azure portal. Now, since this isn’t a course on using queues, we’re not going to get into all the details of how to use it, but I wanted to at least show you how to create a queue.</p>
<p>On the screen here, you can see I’m logged into my Azure portal. I’m at the home page and I’m logged in as an admin. To create a queue service, what I need to do is browse to my storage accounts. And then from the overview page of my storage accounts, I simply click on the queues box here.</p>
<p>Now from the queues page, I can see what existing queues I have set up. I can also see what authentication method I’m using. Now to create my queue, it’s a pretty straightforward process. I simply click the plus queue button up here and then give my queue a name.</p>
<p>Now my name for the queue needs to be all lowercase. It must start with a letter or a number, and it can only include letters, numbers, or hyphens. So I’m just going to call this myqueue. And then we’ll click okay here. And then we can see here myqueue is created and it gives me the URL to access that queue. And that’s really all there is to creating a queue.</p>
<p>Now, before we go, I’ll just show you quickly how to add a message to that queue through the portal. And to do that, I simply click on my queue here and then add a message. Now what I’ll do here, I’ll just add some kind of message text here. And we can set the expiration. I’ll just leave the defaults there.</p>
<p>Now because Microsoft recommends encoding binary data, this checkbox here for encode the message body in Base64 is checked by default. So we’ll leave it there and we’ll go ahead and click okay. And now we can see the message in our queue. If we select the message, we can look at some of the message properties. We can see the body of the message, when that message was inserted into the queue and when it expires. </p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to dequeue this message or remove it from the queue, we simply click the dequeue message. Now since this is the first and only message in my queue, it’s asking me if I’m sure I want to remove the first message in the queue. We’ll go ahead and click yes. And now we can see, we have no more messages in our queue.</p>
<p>So that’s the long and short of it on how to create a queue, how to add a message to a queue, and how to dequeue that message.</p>
<h1 id="An-Introduction-to-Azure-Table-Storage"><a href="#An-Introduction-to-Azure-Table-Storage" class="headerlink" title="An Introduction to Azure Table Storage"></a>An Introduction to Azure Table Storage</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Azure table storage. In this lesson, we will take a look at what table storage is and what it’s used for. </p>
<p>Azure table storage is a storage service offered by Microsoft that allows you to store structured no SQL data in the cloud. It provides a key&#x2F;attribute store with a schema-less design. When I say schema-less here, what I mean is that the data does not conform to a rigid schema. In other words, it doesn’t conform to specific data types that a typical relational database would conform to. </p>
<p>Organizations will often use table storage to store flexible databases that include things like user data for Web applications or maybe even address books or device information. Table storage allows you to store all kinds of entities in a table. Storage accounts can contain as many tables as you need up to the capacity limits of the storage account itself. </p>
<p>Azure table storage, which is actually a NoSQL datastore, often comes into play when an organization needs to store large amounts of structured data. It’s perfect for scenarios that require the storage of structured non-relational data. For example, table storage would be a good choice if you need to store terabytes of structured data required for web scale applications. If you have datasets that don’t require complex joins, foreign keys, or stored procedures, table storage would be a good choice, assuming those data sets can be denormalized for fast access.</p>
<p>Leveraging Azure table storage allows you to store and query massive sets of structured nonrelational data.</p>
<p>Table storage consists of several different components. The URL format for accessing Azure table storage can be seen on your screen.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">http://&lt;storage account&gt;.table.core.windows.net/&lt;table&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Notice the URL includes the storage account name and the table name. It’s the inclusion of these values that makes the URL address unique.</p>
<p>The storage account is another component that helps comprise the Azure table storage offering. The function of the Azure storage account is simple. Access to all Azure storage, including table storage, is provided through a storage account.</p>
<p>The third piece of Azure table storage is the table itself. All a table is is a collection of entities. What makes an Azure table storage table different from a typical relational database table is the fact that it doesn’t enforce a schema on the entities within it. This means that a single table can, and often does, contain all kinds of entities with many different sets of properties.</p>
<p>Speaking of entities, the entity is the fourth component that makes up the Azure table storage offering. The best way to describe an entity is that it is similar to a typical database row. It’s essentially a set of properties. Each entity in Azure storage can be up to 1 MB in size.</p>
<p>The properties, which make up the fifth component, are name-value pairs. You can include up to 252 properties for each entity. There are also three system properties associated with each entity as well. These include a partition key, a row key, and a timestamp.</p>
<p>The image on your screen depicts the relationship among each of these components. As you can see the storage account holds the tables. Each table consists of the entities. Each entity consists of many different properties. The URL that we mentioned earlier is how you access all of this stuff.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, I will show you how to create an Azure storage table using the Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-an-Azure-Storage-Table"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-an-Azure-Storage-Table" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating an Azure Storage Table"></a>DEMO: Creating an Azure Storage Table</h1><p>Welcome back. In this brief demonstration, we are going to walk through the process of creating an Azure Storage table in the Azure portal. As you can see here, I’m logged into my portal as my admin, and I’m on the homepage. We have my storage account here, test9878storage. This obviously is a prerequisite to create a table.</p>
<p>So what we’ll do to begin the process of creating our storage table is select our storage account. And then from the overview page, we can select tables. Now from this table storage page, we can see I have no tables defined yet.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I didn’t mention in the lecture is that there is a premium table experience and it’s not necessarily table storage per se so I didn’t cover it in the course, but this premium table experience is offered through Cosmos DB. And if I open this up here, it takes me out to Azure Cosmos DB and what Azure Cosmos DB is is a globally distributed database service.</p>
<p>Now, what Cosmos DB offers is a premium Azure table API. And so that’s why we didn’t get into it because it’s not really table storage as part of the Azure Storage service offering. But just keep that in mind that there is a premium experience for Azure table API if it comes up in an exam somewhere.</p>
<p>So let’s go back to our test9878storage here. So to create our table, we simply click plus table and we’ll give our table a name. I’ll just call it MyTable and we’ll OK it. And from there, we can see our new table has been created along with a URL to access that table.</p>
<p>If we click the ellipsis here for the context menu, we can configure access policies or delete the table altogether. Now, since this is an introduction to Azure Storage, we’re not going to get into table design and actually doing things with the table storage. I just wanted to introduce you, hence the name of the course, to this storage option so you have an idea of what it is, where you access it and how you create a table.</p>
<p>So with that, we’ll call it a wrap and I’ll see you in the next lesson.</p>
<h1 id="Introduction-to-Azure-Managed-Disks"><a href="#Introduction-to-Azure-Managed-Disks" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Azure Managed Disks"></a>Introduction to Azure Managed Disks</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Azure managed disks. In this lesson, we’re going to take a look at the benefits of managed disks and at the types of encryption you can use with managed disks. Let’s start by identifying what a managed disk is in Azure. An Azure managed disk is similar to a physical disk that you would find in a physical on-prem server, but it’s virtualized. It’s a block level storage volume that’s used with Azure VMs and is managed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>.</p>
<p>Creating a managed disk in Microsoft Azure is as simple as specifying the size of the disk, and the type of the disk you want to use. When you provision a managed disk, you have a choice of several different types. You can deploy ultra disks, premium SSD disks, standard SSD disks, and standard HDD disks. We will actually look at these types in a little more detail in the next lesson. But for now, we’re just going to look at the benefits of using managed disks.</p>
<p>For starters, managed disks are designed for 99.999% availability. That’s five nines of availability. To achieve this level of availability, there are three replicas of the data stored on each managed disk. This type of durability protects you from not only one, but two failures of disk replicas.</p>
<p>Managed disks make it easy to deploy and scale VMs. Microsoft Azure allows up to 50,000 VM disks of a specific type per region in each subscription. This allows you to create thousands of virtual machines in one subscription. Because Azure supports so many disks, you can create VM scale sets that include up to 1000 VMs per set, provided you use a marketplace image. </p>
<p>I should point out that managed disks are integrated with both availability sets and availability zones. The integration with availability sets ensures that VM disks within an availability set are isolated from one another. This protects your applications from a single point of failure within an Azure datacenter. Availability zone integration protects applications from entire Azure datacenter failures.</p>
<p>Since Azure backup supports the backup and restore of managed disks, you can use Azure backup to create backup jobs to protect your data. This makes VM restores a snap. I should mention, however, at the time of this course publication, Azure backup supports disk sizes up to 32 terabytes.</p>
<p>Through Azure role-based access control, or RBAC, you can specify granular access control for managed disks. You can assign specific permissions for managed disks to your users.</p>
<p>Lastly, Azure managed disks make it easier to upload your on-prem VMs to Azure because you can use direct upload to transfer your VHD files to Azure managed disks. There are far fewer steps to uploading your VHDs than there used to be.</p>
<p>There are two types of encryption that you can use with managed disks. They include server-side encryption, or SSE, and Azure disk encryption, or ADE.</p>
<p>Server-side encryption is performed by the Azure storage service, and is enabled by default for all managed disks. This type of encryption provides encryption at rest for your data. Server-side encryption is also enabled by default for snapshots and images in regions where managed disks are available.</p>
<p>Azure disk encryption is enabled on the OS and data disks of a VM. Using Azure disk encryption, you can encrypt the OS and data disks for a virtual machine, including managed disks. On Windows VMs, the disks are encrypted using bit locker technology. While on Linux VMs, the disks are encrypted using DM-crypt technology.</p>
<p>There are three disk roles in Azure. These roles include data disks, OS disks, and temporary disks.</p>
<p>Data disks are managed disks that you attach to a virtual machine. They’re used to store applications and other sorts of data that you need. When you attach a data disk to a VM, it’s registered as a SCSI drive. You can assign a drive letter to a data disk just like any other physical disk in a physical server. Data disks have a max capacity of 32 terabytes, and the number of data disks that you can attach to a virtual machine will be determined by the size of the virtual machine itself.</p>
<p>OS disks are pretty self-explanatory. When you deploy a virtual machine, it’s deployed with a single OS disk attached. The OS disk, as you may have guessed, hosts the VM’s operating system and boot volume. The max capacity of an OS disk is four terabytes.</p>
<p>Temporary disks are probably the most misunderstood of the three disk types. Every VM contains a temporary disk. I should mention, however, that the temporary disk is not a managed disk. The temporary disk is not intended for storage of important data. Instead, temporary disks are used to host things like page files and swap files. Data that is stored on a temporary disk is often lost during maintenance events and when a VM is redeployed. The temporary disk is assigned the drive letter of D on Windows machines by default. On Azure Linux VMs, the temporary disk is &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdb.</p>
<h1 id="Course-Summary"><a href="#Course-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Course Summary"></a>Course Summary</h1><p>Congratulations. You’ve come to the end of Introduction to Azure Storage. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We kicked things off with an introduction to azure storage. You learned about the core storage services in Azure and about the different storage account types that are available. You also got to see a demonstration that showed you how to create a storage account in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>We then took a look at the different storage services in a little more detail. We started with blob storage, where you learned what it is and what it offers. Next, we dove into Azure Files.</p>
<p>After covering Azure Files, we got into Azure queues, where you learned what Azure queues are and how to create a queue.</p>
<p>After learning about Azure queues, you learned about Azure tables. You learned why they are used and when to use Azure them.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with Azure disks. </p>
<p>At this point, you should have a solid understanding of the storage offerings in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>To learn more about Microsoft Azure storage options, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy, because we’re always publishing new ones. Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching and happy learning.</p>
