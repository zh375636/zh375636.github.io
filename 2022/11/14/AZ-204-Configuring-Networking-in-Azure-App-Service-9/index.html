        <h1 id="Configuring-Networking-in-Azure-App-Service-Introduction"><a href="#Configuring-Networking-in-Azure-App-Service-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Networking in Azure App Service - Introduction"></a>Configuring Networking in Azure App Service - Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Configuring Networking in Azure App Service”. In this course, I’ll cover the most commonly used networking configurations in App Service. First, I’ll explain how to create a custom domain name for your app. Then, I’ll show you how to enable TLS&#x2F;SSL so people can reach your app using HTTPS. Finally, I’ll explain different ways of controlling inbound and outbound connections to and from your app.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should already have some basic knowledge of both App Service and Azure networking. It would also help to have some knowledge of DNS, that is, the Domain Name System.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Custom-Domains"><a href="#Custom-Domains" class="headerlink" title="Custom Domains"></a>Custom Domains</h1><p>One of the most common things you’ll need to do when you create an app using Azure App Service is to set it up with a custom domain name. That’s because, by default, an App Service app has a URL that ends with the “.azurewebsites.net” domain, which probably isn’t what you want for a commercial website. For example, if you have an app that should be hosted at a site called contoso.com, then you’ll need to tell App Service to use that custom domain name. </p>
<p>Here’s how to do that. First, you need to make sure your App Service Plan is using a paid tier because custom domains are not supported in the free F1 tier.</p>
<p>Next, let’s assume that you’ve already registered your domain name with a domain provider and that you can edit the DNS records for your domain. This isn’t a DNS course, so I’m not going to go into detail about how DNS works. I’ll just explain what you need to do to set up a custom domain for an App Service app. If you’re not familiar with DNS, then it would be a good idea to learn more about it before you make changes to your DNS records.</p>
<p>Okay, now go into the Custom Domain settings for your app in App Service and find the Custom Domain Verification ID. This is something that you’ll add to your domain records to prove to Microsoft that you own the domain. Copy the verification ID and paste it into a text editor. You’ll also need to copy the IP address of your app and the existing URL of the app from the Custom Domains page. The existing URL will end in “.azurewebsites.net”. Paste both of these values into a text editor as well.</p>
<p>Now go to your domain provider’s website and open your DNS records. If you’re going to use a root domain, such as contoso.com, for your app, then create an A record. If you’re going to use a subdomain, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.contoso.com/">www.contoso.com</a>, then create a CNAME record. You’ll often want to do both.</p>
<p>In the A record, set the name to ‘@’ (which means the root domain), and set the value to the IP address of your app. In the CNAME record, set the name to the subdomain, such as www, and set the value to the existing URL of your app.</p>
<p>Now to prove to Microsoft that you own this domain and its subdomain, you need to create a TXT record for each of them. A TXT record is just an informational record that doesn’t affect the resolution of your domain name. For the root domain, set the name to asuid, which I’m assuming stands for “App Service Unique Identifier”, and set the value to the Custom Domain Verification ID that you copied from App Service. For the subdomain, set the name to asuid dot and the subdomain, so it would be asuid.www in our example. And set the value to the Custom Domain Verification ID.</p>
<p>Now you need to go back to the Custom Domains page for your App Service app and add your custom domain. You just need to put in the name of the domain and the DNS record type, which will be either A or CNAME, depending on whether you’re adding the root domain or a subdomain. Then you click the “Validate” button, and Azure checks for the DNS records that you added. If it works, then your app is now accessible using your custom domain name.</p>
<h1 id="Enabling-TLS-x2F-SSL"><a href="#Enabling-TLS-x2F-SSL" class="headerlink" title="Enabling TLS&#x2F;SSL"></a>Enabling TLS&#x2F;SSL</h1><p>After you’ve configured a custom domain for your app, it will only be accessible at a URL starting with “http”, which is an insecure protocol. These days, every website should be able to respond to requests over HTTPS, which is the secure version of HTTP. To set that up, you need to enable TLS&#x2F;SSL, which takes a bit of work.</p>
<p>First, you need to make sure that the tier of your App Service Plan is at least Basic because the Free and Shared tiers don’t support TLS&#x2F;SSL for custom domains.</p>
<p>Second, you need to have a TLS&#x2F;SSL certificate file. This type of file contains a private key and a certificate with a public key. These are needed for a couple of reasons. First, the public&#x2F;private key pair is used to encrypt and decrypt traffic between the website and the browser of anyone visiting the site. Second, the certificate verifies that the browser is interacting directly with the website.</p>
<p>This might seem like an unnecessary step, but it helps prevent something called a man-in-the-middle attack. This is where another computer is intercepting messages between two parties (the web server and the browser in this case) and listening in on the conversation. In some cases, it will even change the messages. However, if the web server starts an encrypted conversation by presenting a certificate that is verified by a trusted certificate authority, then the browser can be sure that it’s communicating directly with the webserver.</p>
<p>Third, you need to create a TLS binding to your custom domain.</p>
<p>Now let’s get into the details of how to do steps 2 and 3. So where do you get a certificate file? The easiest way is to use the free App Service managed certificate. It’s provided by Digicert, which is the certificate authority that verifies the authenticity of the certificate. This solution won’t work in all cases, but it works for most situations, and it’s free, so it’s hard to beat that. If you need to do something special, then you can import a certificate file that you obtained from somewhere else.</p>
<p>To create a free certificate, go into the TLS&#x2F;SSL settings for your App Service app, then select Private Key Certificates, and click Create App Service Managed Certificate. Then tell it which custom domain you want to create the certificate for, and that’s it.</p>
<p>Once you have a private key certificate, whether it’s a free one or one that you imported from elsewhere, then you can bind TLS&#x2F;SSL to your domain.</p>
<p>Other than specifying the custom domain and the certificate, you need to tell it whether to use SNI SSL or IP SSL. SNI SSL binds the certificate using the website’s hostname, while IP SSL binds the certificate to the website’s IP address. SNI SSL gives you more flexibility, and it’s easier to configure, so it’s usually the best choice. The only disadvantage is that it doesn’t work on really old browsers, and when I say “really old”, I mean it. All major browsers have provided support for SNI SSL since 2007.</p>
<p>Once you’ve bound your certificate to your custom domain, people will be able to access your app using HTTPS. However, they’ll still be able to access it using HTTP, which is not encrypted, so if you want to ensure that everyone will access your site over HTTPS, then you can select the “HTTPS only” option in your app’s TLS&#x2F;SSL settings. There’s also a “Minimum TLS Version” option. By default, it’s set to 1.2, which is the recommended version, but you can set it to 1.0 or 1.1 if you want to support older browsers. It’s usually best to leave it set to 1.2, though.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of binding a certificate to a custom domain is that it lets a client device know that it’s communicating with a legitimate website and not a hacker. But the website has no way of knowing that’s it’s communicating with a legitimate client and not a hacker. If you require that level of security, then you can enable TLS mutual authentication. This is also known as client certificate authentication. It’s typically used only within an individual organization because it requires that all client devices have a client certificate.</p>
<p>To enable this, you need to go into the general configuration settings for your app, and set “Client certificate mode” to “Require”. You have to do more to make it work, though, because App Service doesn’t handle the client authentication. It just forwards the client certificate to your app. So, you need to add code to your app to handle the authentication. App Service forwards the client certificate as a base-64 encoded value in an X-ARR-ClientCert request header.</p>
<p>And that’s it for enabling TLS&#x2F;SSL.</p>
<h1 id="Inbound-and-Outbound-Connections"><a href="#Inbound-and-Outbound-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Inbound and Outbound Connections"></a>Inbound and Outbound Connections</h1><p>By default, a web app created using App Service can only be accessed through the internet. But there are many cases when you’d want to be able to connect to an app in different ways. For example, you might want an app to only be accessible internally rather than over the internet, or you might want to connect the app to a database in either Azure or an on-premises environment.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to connect to or from an app, depending on exactly what you need to do. These methods can be divided into two groups: inbound (for connecting to an app) and outbound (for connecting from an app to other resources).</p>
<p>We’ll start with the inbound methods. If you’re okay with your app communicating over the internet, but you want to restrict which IP addresses can connect to it, then the easiest way to do that is to add access restriction rules to your app. Each rule either allows or denies access to a single IP address or a block of IP addresses.</p>
<p>If you have resources in an Azure virtual network that need to connect to your app over the Microsoft backbone network rather than over the internet, then you can restrict access to your app using a service endpoint rather than an IP address. A service endpoint is something you can enable on a subnet. So you can create a service-endpoint-based rule that allows access to your app from a particular subnet in a VNet.</p>
<p>A newer way of doing this is to create a private endpoint for your app. This is a private IP address in your VNet that gets attached to your app. One advantage of using a private endpoint is that it makes it easy to connect to your app from an on-premises environment. If you already have a connection from your on-premises environment to your Azure VNet using a method such as Azure ExpressRoute or Azure VPN, then you can connect to the app through the private endpoint in the VNet. This is more difficult to do with a service endpoint. For this and other reasons, Microsoft recommends using private endpoints rather than service endpoints.</p>
<p>All of the methods I’ve mentioned so far have been for controlling inbound connections to your app. To allow your app to initiate outbound connections to various resources, we need to use different methods. An outbound connection is typically used to connect an app to a database or other type of supporting resource.</p>
<p>App Service Hybrid Connections is a feature that allows an app to connect to a resource in an Azure virtual network or an on-premises environment. To make it work, you need to install Hybrid Connection Manager on a Windows Server that has access to both networks over port 443. App Service then uses this as a relay to connect to the other environment. The advantage of using Hybrid Connections is that it provides secure access even if you don’t have an ExpressRoute or VPN connection between your on-premises environment and Azure.</p>
<p>Another method is called VNet Integration. There are two different types: Regional VNet Integration and Gateway-required VNet Integration. The great thing about the Regional method is that you don’t need to install anything.</p>
<p>To configure it in App Service, you go into the Networking section of your app’s configuration and select VNet Integration. Then you just need to tell it which VNet you want to add. If the VNet that you want to integrate with is in the same region as the app, then the only requirement is that the VNet has to have an empty subnet that the Integration feature can use.</p>
<p>Once you’ve configured Regional VNet Integration, then your app can connect to resources in the VNet or in an on-premises network that’s connected to the VNet through ExpressRoute or a VPN. It can even connect to a VNet in a different region if there’s a peering connection between that VNet and the regional VNet.</p>
<p>Pretty much the only reason you’d need to use Gateway-required VNet Integration is if your app needs to connect to a VNet in another region that isn’t peered with a regional VNet. In that case, you’d need to install a virtual network gateway in the remote VNet. This method has a number of disadvantages, though, such as not allowing connections to on-premises environments over ExpressRoute. So, in most cases, it’s better to use Regional VNet Integration than Gateway-required VNet Integration.</p>
<p>And that’s it for configuring networking in Azure App Service. Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks!</p>
