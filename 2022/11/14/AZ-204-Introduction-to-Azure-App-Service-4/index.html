        <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to “Introduction to Azure App Service”. I’m Guy Hummel, and I’m a certified Azure Developer and Solutions Architect.</p>
<p>In this course, I’ll start with an overview of Azure App Service, and then I’ll show you how to create a simple app. Finally, I’ll go over App Service Plans. This course is not intended to explain every aspect of Azure App Service, which is quite a complex product. Instead, it’s intended to help you get started with hosting web apps on Azure. We cover additional aspects of App Service, such as autoscaling, deployment slots, networking, and security, in other courses.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should already have some basic experience using Azure. If you don’t have any experience with Azure, then you can take our “Microsoft Azure Fundamentals” learning path.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. Thanks!</p>
<h1 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>When you need to host a website on Azure, there are lots of potential choices. If it’s a static website that doesn’t require any interactions with users, then you can just store your website in Azure Storage and serve it from there. If you need to host something more sophisticated, then you could deploy it on an Azure virtual machine that’s running a content management system, such as WordPress. If you’ve built a microservices-based application in Docker containers, then you could run it on Azure Kubernetes Service.</p>
<p>But the most popular way to do it is to use Azure App Service. Why? Well, because App Service tries to make deploying a web application as easy as possible while still providing lots of flexibility and features. It’s considered to be a platform-as-a-service rather than infrastructure-as-a-service because it manages the underlying infrastructure for you. This means you don’t have to worry about things like patching the operating system.</p>
<p>App Service supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, including ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Not only do these come preinstalled, but they’re also updated when new patches or releases are available. For most of these frameworks, you can choose whether to run it on Windows or Linux (although that’s not the case with ASP.NET Framework 4.8, which can only run on Windows).</p>
<p>Even if you want to use a different programming language, you can still use App Service if you put your application in a Docker container that has the right dependencies installed in it.</p>
<p>There are other key development and deployment features, too. First, it’s well-integrated with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, which are the preferred programming environments for many software developers. It’s also integrated with continuous integration &#x2F; continuous delivery tools, such as Azure DevOps, GitHub, and BitBucket. You can also use App Service to host mobile backends and application programming interfaces.</p>
<p>Aside from the ease of deployment and maintenance, one of the biggest advantages of using App Service is its enterprise-class features. First, there’s high availability. Microsoft guarantees 99.95% uptime in most cases for apps running on this service. Then there’s scalability. You can configure it to automatically add more resources to your application when demand increases.</p>
<p>Of course, security is important, too, so Microsoft provides authentication capabilities if you only want authorized users to be able to access your apps. It also lets you control which IP addresses are allowed or denied access to your site if you want.</p>
<p>There are other features as well, but this should give you a good idea of why App Service is the preferred choice for hosting web apps on Azure.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-a-Simple-App"><a href="#Creating-a-Simple-App" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Simple App"></a>Creating a Simple App</h1><p>Now I’ll show you how easy it is to deploy an application on Azure App Service. In fact, it only takes one command to do it.</p>
<p>There are a few different options for where we could deploy it from. We could use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the Azure Command-Line Interface. I’m going to use the Azure CLI because it’s possible to use it without having to install anything. Microsoft provides something called the Cloud Shell that brings up a small virtual machine that has the Azure CLI and other tools installed on it.</p>
<p>To open it, you click here in the Azure Portal. If you haven’t used it before, then it’ll ask you for permission to create a storage account that the Cloud Shell VM can use. But I’ve used it before, so it comes right up.</p>
<p>Before we can deploy an app, we need to get one from somewhere. I’m going to use a sample .NET application. To get it, you can type this command.[dotnet new webapp -n MyFirstAzureWebApp -f net6.0 &amp;&amp; cd MyFirstAzureWebApp] To save you some typing, I’ve included this command in the transcript below. This command also moves you into the MyFirstAzureWebApp folder, which is where the app was downloaded.</p>
<p>Now that we have the app, we can deploy it to App Service using this command.[az webapp up –sku F1 –name <app-name>] The “az” means it’s an Azure command. “webapp” is the command for App Service. “up” tells it to create the web app using the code in the current directory. “sku F1” means that we want to use the free tier so we won’t be charged for this service. I’ll explain more about service tiers later. Then we say “–name” and what we want to call the app. I’m calling it “ca” for Cloud Academy”, “webapp”. You’ll have to call it something else because the name has to be unique among all of the App Service names across all Azure customers.</app-name></p>
<p>There are quite a few other options we can add, but we can get away with only including these ones. Some of the other most common options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>–resource-group for the resource group that it will put your App Service instance in</li>
<li>–location to specify the Azure region where your app will be hosted</li>
<li>–plan to specify which App Service Plan to use. I’ll tell you more about this in the next lecture.</li>
<li>–os-type, which can be either Windows or Linux. If you don’t specify one, then it’ll default to “Windows”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we didn’t specify any of these options, it’s going to create a new resource group and a new App Service Plan using default names, it will put everything in your default location, and it will use Windows for the operating system.</p>
<p>[Hit Enter]Okay, this is going to take a while, so I’ll fast-forward.</p>
<p>All right, it’s done. You can see the choices it made for the options we left out. For example, here’s what it called the App Service Plan, and here’s what it called the resource group.</p>
<p>Now to bring up the app we just deployed, we can use this link. We can click on it, but notice that it’s going to include the quote at the end, so it’ll give us an error. That’s okay because we can just remove the extra bit at the end.</p>
<p>That’s better. This is a very simple web page because that’s all that’s in the sample app. Now, suppose we wanted to make a change to the app. Normally, you’d probably do that in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, but we can actually do it from Cloud Shell, too.</p>
<p>If you click here, it’ll bring up an editor. First, we’ll go into the MyFirstAzureWebApp folder, and then go into the Pages folder, which is where we’ll find the home page for our app. It’s called Index.cshtml.</p>
<p>Right now, the main text on the home page is just “Welcome”. Let’s change it to “Welcome to Azure”. Now we’ll save it and then close the editor.</p>
<p>Okay, we’re back at the command line. If we hit the up arrow, it’ll bring back our previous command. To update our app, we’ll use the “az webapp up” command again, but this time, we don’t need to specify the sku or the name.[Erase them and hit Enter.] I’ll fast-forward again.</p>
<p>All right, it’s done. Now if we go back to the web page and hit refresh, you’ll see that the message changed to “Welcome to Azure”, so it worked.</p>
<p>And that’s it for creating and updating a simple app.</p>
<h1 id="App-Service-Plans"><a href="#App-Service-Plans" class="headerlink" title="App Service Plans"></a>App Service Plans</h1><p>Although Azure App Service takes care of managing the underlying infrastructure for you, you still need to decide what type of infrastructure it should use. To do that, you need to create an App Service Plan.</p>
<p>The three main settings you have to choose in an App Service Plan are the operating system, the region, and the pricing tier. The operating system can be either Windows or Linux. For the region, you typically choose the one that’s closest to where most of your users are located, such as East US. Bear in mind that you can’t change a service plan’s region. So if you decide to move an app to another region later, you’ll have to make a copy of it and put it in a new App Service Plan.</p>
<p>Those first two settings are usually pretty easy to choose, but the pricing tier is much more complex. This is where you decide what type of compute resources to allocate and what App Service features you want. This table shows a summary of the different tiers, although it doesn’t actually show all of the options and features in each tier. I’ll walk you through some of the highlights.</p>
<p>If you’ll be using this plan for development and testing, then you can probably get away with using a low-powered and inexpensive option. The Free tier is a good choice as long as you only need 60 CPU minutes per day. If you need more CPU time than that, then you’ll have to go with a plan that costs money.</p>
<p>The next step up is the Shared tier, which is also known as the D1 tier. It gives you up to 240 CPU minutes per day. It’s called the Shared tier because you have to share compute resources with other Azure customers. That’s the case with the Free tier as well. Both of these tiers have just one gig of RAM and one gig of storage, so you can’t do too much with them. The Shared tier also allows you to use a custom domain name for your app’s website, which isn’t something you can do with the Free tier.</p>
<p>If you need more resources, then you can go with the Basic tier, which puts your apps on dedicated virtual machines instead of shared VMs. There are several options that vary based on the number of virtual CPU cores and the amount of memory. All of the options come with 10 gig of storage.</p>
<p>The next step up is the Standard tier, but although it has 50 gig of storage instead of 10 gig, the CPU and memory options are exactly the same as the Basic tier. The big difference is that the Standard tier supports autoscaling, which means it can automatically add more virtual machines to handle increased traffic. It lets you use up to 10 VM instances. That’s significantly more than the Basic tier, which has a maximum of 3 VM instances.</p>
<p>The Premium tier has options for more CPU, memory, and storage, and it lets you use up to 30 VM instances in most Azure regions.</p>
<p>The Isolated tier gives you a private, dedicated environment that’s in its own virtual network. While the Standard and Premium tiers allow you to connect your dedicated VMs to a virtual network, the Isolated tier actually puts your VMs in a private virtual network so they’re isolated from other App Service instances. It lets you have up to 100 VM instances.</p>
<p>Regardless of which pricing tier you choose, it’s possible to put multiple apps in your service plan. But all of those apps will share the same compute resources, so if you put too many apps in the same service plan, then you’ll run into performance issues.</p>
<p>One potential way to resolve this problem would be to add more virtual machine instances up to the limit of the number of instances allowed in the pricing tier you’ve chosen. This is known as scaling out. It’s also possible to set up autoscaling, which is such a complex topic that we cover it in a separate course.</p>
<p>If scaling out doesn’t solve the problem, then you can switch your plan to a pricing tier that has more powerful instances and&#x2F;or a higher limit on the number of instances you can have. This is called scaling up, and it’s very easy to do. You can simply select the new pricing tier, and it will only take seconds to go into effect.</p>
<p>And that’s it for App Service Plans.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>All right, let’s do a quick review of what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>Azure App Service tries to make deploying a web application as easy as possible by managing the underlying infrastructure for you.</p>
<p>It supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, including ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and Python.

<p>To use a different programming language, put your application in a Docker container that has the right dependencies installed in it.</p>
<p>You can deploy apps to App Service from Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the Azure Command-Line Interface. To do it from the command line, use “az webapp up”.</p>
<p>The three main settings you have to choose in an App Service Plan are the operating system, the region, and the pricing tier.</p>
<p>If you choose the Free tier or the Shared tier, you have to share compute resources with other Azure customers.</p>
<p>If you choose the Basic tier or higher, your apps will be put on dedicated virtual machines instead of on shared VMs.</p>
<p>Autoscaling is supported on the Standard tier and higher.</p>
<p>The Premium tier has options for more CPU, memory, and storage.</p>
<p>The Isolated tier gives you a private, dedicated environment that’s in its own virtual network.</p>
<p>Regardless of which pricing tier you choose, you can put multiple apps in your service plan. But all of those apps will share the same compute resources.</p>
<p>You can scale up the resources in your service plan by switching to a higher pricing tier. You can scale out your service plan’s resources by adding more VMs.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Please give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks!</p>
