<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this course where we shall be looking at two different classifications of AWS services, these being Abstract and container services.</p>
<p>This course focuses on the security best practices that surround the most common services that fall into each of these classifications. To help you adopt and implement the correct level of security within your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Before we start, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Stuart Scott. I’m one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS Amazon Web Services. Feel free to connect with me with any questions using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy using the community forum where one of our Cloud experts will respond to your question.</p>
<p>This course has been designed to help those who implement or manage cloud security, such as a cloud solutions architect, cloud security specialist, or similar. This course will also be useful for anyone looking to enhance their AWS security skills across a number of different services.</p>
<p>This course will cover a range of topics, including:</p>
<p>What are AWS Abstract and container services? This lecture provides you with a clear understanding of what Abstract and container services are within AWS.There is a clear divide between the two which be understood as responsibilities around security is a key difference between them.</p>
<p>Security controls, data at rest and in transit. Here we will take a look at some of the available options and best practices to help you maintain integrity and protection around your data when at rest, in transit, and held within a number of container and Abstract services.</p>
<p>Security controls, network segmentation. In this lecture, we’ll look at how we can use the network infrastructure and architecture to connect and restrict access to our container and Abstract services to increase security through a number of different controls.</p>
<p>Identity and access management. IAM is heavily used for both container and Abstract services and plays a key part in authorization and authentication for access and management. This lecture looks at how IAM can be used to help protect access across your services.</p>
<p>Built-in service security controls. This lecture will briefly look at some of the service specific security controls that may not have been covered in the previous lectures that you can leverage to help secure your data and environment.</p>
<p>As a student of this course, you will obtain the following:</p>
<p>An understanding of the difference between both container and Abstract services within AWS and how security is managed differently between the two.</p>
<p>An awareness of how data can be protected at rest and in transit for different services.</p>
<p>A comprehension of the importance of network design in increasing the security of Abstract and container based services.</p>
<p>The ability to apply the correct level of security to your services depending on their classification, container or Abstract using security features from other AWS services as well as the services own built-in protection.</p>
<p>During this course I will cover some of the common services under container and Abstract services. As it is discussed, it will help to have a basic level of understanding of these services but it’s not imperative to understand the details. With container services, we’ll be looking at RDS, EMR, and Elastic Beanstalk. For Abstract services, we’ll be looking at S3, DynamoDB, and SQS. In addition to these services, a basic understanding of the following is also recommended, VPCs and IAM.</p>
<p>As this course is focused on best practices rather than a detailed instructional how to course, there may be terms and phrases that are unfamiliar to you that you may want additional information and clarity on. Therefore, I will attach a glossary to this course which you can find on the course’s landing page.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy are valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you could use the comments section found on the landing page of this course.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture. Coming up next, we will take a look at what container and Abstract services are and the differences between them.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Abstract-and-Container-Services"><a href="#AWS-Abstract-and-Container-Services" class="headerlink" title="AWS Abstract and Container Services"></a>AWS Abstract and Container Services</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture, where we shall look at what AWS abstract and container services are, as well as the differences between them.</p>
<p>So, before we get into the nitty gritty of security contact, it’s important that we understand what AWS defines as these abstract and container services. There was a chance that when I mentioned container services, you may immediately been thinking of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-ec2-instance-types-explained/">AWS EC2 Container Service</a>, knows as ECS, and its association with Docker; however, this is something completely different, as I already explained during this lecture, but I just wanted to clarify that point straightaway.</p>
<p>Both container and abstract services can be seen as different service classifications. We are aware of AWS service categories which can be seen from the AWS Management Console such as Compute, Storage, and Database, but the classifications that are referred to are not listed or defined within the Management Console. So, what are they?</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at what is defined by AWS Container Services.</p>
<p>Services that fall under container services have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>the service itself runs on separate infrastructure instances, such as EC2.</li>
<li>AWS is responsible for managing the operating system and the platform.</li>
<li>A managed service is provided by AWS, which is typically the service itself for the actual application which are seen as containers.</li>
<li>As a user of these container services, you have a number of management and security responsibilities, including managing network access security, such as network access control list rules and any firewalls.</li>
<li>Also, platform-level identity and access management where it exists.</li>
<li>Examples of AWS container services include Relational Database Service, Elastic Mapreduce, and Elastic Beanstalk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if we take a lot of the characteristics of abstract services to see how these compare …</p>
<ul>
<li>These services are removed, abstracted, from the platform or management layer which cloud applications are built on.</li>
<li>The services are accessed via endpoints using AWS application programming interfaces, APIs.</li>
<li>The underlying infrastructure, operating system, and platform is managed by AWS.</li>
<li>The abstracted services provide a multi-tenancy platform on which the underlying infrastructure is shared.</li>
<li>Data is isolated via security mechanisms.</li>
<li>Abstract services have a strong integration with IAM, and examples of abstract services include S3, DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, and SQS.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you can see, the main differences between the two relate to responsibilities, control, and the level of administration and customization you have over the chosen service. Container services provide you with a greater level of control and responsibility than those of abstracted services, largely due to the fact they are not providing shared tenancy of the underlying service infrastructure, whereas abstract services do. Also, abstract services are not typically deployed within specific availability zones, as they are accessed via endpoints and so are abstracted from your VPC infrastructure.</p>
<p>As listed within these two definitions, there are some boundaries between responsibilities of security between you and AWS, and this is an important point. So let’s look at this in greater detail, as it will help you understand and define the differences between the two.</p>
<p>One of the main principles of AWS security is that it operates its security processes via a model called the AWS shared responsibility model. This dictates which security controls are AWS’s responsibility and which are yours. Now, depending on the service being used and deployed within AWS, the boundaries of responsibilities will vary. When planning and architecting your security policies, it’s essential you have a clear understanding of where these boundaries lay for difference services.</p>
<p>There are three main models that AWS uses to define these responsibilities, these being:</p>
<ol>
<li>the shared responsibility model for infrastructure services</li>
<li>the shared responsibility model for container services and</li>
<li>the shared responsibility model for abstract services.</li>
</ol>
<p>By taking a look at each of these models, we will be able to clearly see the differences. So let’s start by looking at the first model, based upon infrastructure, which includes services such as EC2. We will see how the level of responsibility shifts as we move onto container and then abstract services.</p>
<p>Although this course does not cover infrastructure services, I just want to graphically show you the change of responsibility as we go through the different models.</p>
<p>As we can see from this model, it’s down to you to decide how secure you want your resources to sit in the cloud while AWS guarantees the global security of the cloud.</p>
<p>Looking at AWS responsibilities first, this covers the global infrastructure elements: regions, availability zones, and edge locations, and also the foundation of their services, covering compute, storage, database, and network.</p>
<p>AWS owns and controls access to their data centers, where your data resides. This covers physical access to all hardware and networking components, and any additional data center facilities, including generators, UPS, power distribution units, computer room air conditioning, and fire suppression systems. Essentially, AWS is responsible for the components that make up the cloud. Any data put into the cloud then becomes your responsibility.</p>
<p>So moving onto your responsibility, and as I’ve just mentioned, securing what goes into the cloud falls upon you. This covers both client and server encryption and network traffic protection. All the way up to the security of the operating system, network, and firewall configuration, followed by application security and identity and access management.</p>
<p>How much of this additional security you wish to implement is entirely your decision. What you choose may depend on the nature of the business or on existing controls you may already have in place. For example, it’s up to you if you want to implement network access control lists, or NACLs, or encrypt your data.</p>
<p>The important point to remember is that while AWS provides many powerful security controls, how and when to apply them is not AWS’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve covered this first model. Let’s see the shift of responsibility as we start to look at container services.</p>
<p>Straightaway, we can see that both platform and application management, along with any operating system and system and network configuration, has shifted to being the responsibility of AWS, and is no longer down to us as the customer to manage. This is a huge difference from that of infrastructure-based services. However, not all responsibility has shifted. Note that firewall configuration remains the responsibility of the end user, which integrates at the platform and application management level. For example, RDS uses security groups of which you would be responsible for configuring and implementing.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the shared responsibility model for abstract services.</p>
<p>You will notice that even more responsibility has been shifted to AWS; specifically, network traffic protection, which AWS will manage via the platform, protecting all data in transit using AWS’s own network. You are responsible for using IAM tools to apply the correct permissions, both at the platform such as S3 bucket policies, and IAM user and group level.</p>
<p>As we progress through each of these models, it’s clear to see that the level of control and responsibility shifts more towards AWS than that of the customer. So how does that affect how we apply security around these services that fall into the container and abstract classifications? How can we ensure that when we use these services, tight integration of security controls are applied? Coming up in the next lecture, we will address these questions.</p>

<h3 id="Lecture-Transcript"><a href="#Lecture-Transcript" class="headerlink" title="Lecture Transcript"></a><strong>Lecture Transcript</strong></h3><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where we sure look at the different security controls that can be used to help you architect and implement a secure solution around your container and abstract services.</p>
<p>From this point onwards within this course I will provide some best practice controls for the following services, for both container and abstract classifications.</p>
<p>So for container services we’ll be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>RDS</li>
<li>EMR, and</li>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk</li>
</ul>
<p>And for the abstract services we’ll be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>S3</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
<li>SQS and</li>
<li>Glacier</li>
</ul>
<p>These services have been selected as they’re some of the most common services utilized within each classification. However, if you’re using container or abstract services other than the ones listed here, then the principles that I cover throughout this course will enable you to look into those services with the same approach and at least be aware of what to look out and architect for when planning and applying your security policies.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s get started by looking at some of these security controls that you can implement to increase the security around these different services. Starting with the protection of your data, but more specifically on how to protect your data at rest.</p>
<p>EMR is a managed service by AWS and is comprised of a cluster of EC2 instances. That’s a highly scalable to process and run big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Spark.</p>
<p>A key point to make it is that by default EMR instances do not encrypt data at rest. The instances used with EMR are created from pre-configured AMIs, Amazon Machine Images, that have been published and released by AWS. You are not able to use your own custom AMIs in an EMR cluster. Similarly, the same applies to EBS volumes for a persistent storage within the cluster which are again supplied by AWS.</p>
<p>EMR can also use DynomoDB or S3 for its persistent data store which you can either access directly or copy the data from these services to its own persistent data store on to HDFS, Hadoop Distributed File System.</p>
<p>Although EMR does not encrypt data at rest by default there are a number of mechanisms you can use if your data is sensitive enough or perhaps you’re required to do so for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>If you decide to use persistent storage rather than S3 or DynamoDB, then there’re a number of options available that can work together, if you enable local disk encryption in your EMR security configuration. Once enabled the following features are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux Unified Key Setup, which allows EBS cluster volumes to be encrypted</li>
<li>Also Open-Source HDFS Encryption, which provides two Hadoop encryption options: Secure Hadoop RPC and Data encryption of HDFS Block Transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned previously, we could use S3 as our persistent data store for EMR. If this was the case then you could use S3’s very own encryption tools. As we know S3 is an abstract service and as a result you could apply server-side encryption SSE-S3, to encrypt the data that is stored at rest. To help with this configuration EMR allows you to apply security configuration that specifies security settings on how you can encrypt your data. You can either encrypt data at rest, data in transit, or, if required, both together. The great thing about these security configurations is that they’re not actually a part of the cluster itself. They exist within EMR and therefore you can reuse the same security configuration for existing clusters or others you plan to use in the future.</p>
<p>As a part of this security configuration you have the choice of AWS managing your encryption keys for you on S3, using the SSE-KMS, Server-Side Encryption with Key Management Service, or by using the SSE-S3 method. Alternatively, you could choose to manage your own encryption keys with client-side encryption. If we refer back to the shared responsibility model for abstract services, we can see this difference of responsibility clearly here.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SSE it’s an encryption method used in Amazon S3 to encrypt any object at rest. It’s completely managed by AWS along with the encryption keys which themselves are also automatically encrypted and rotated regularly by S3. SSE-S3 uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, AES-256, algorithm for its encryption. When using SSE-KMS AWS will configure and create a KMS customer muster key, CMK, and associate all relevant policies to work with your EMR cluster. More information on KMS can be found here.</p>
<p>In addition to SSE, S3 offers Client-Side Encryption with KMS or a customer key provider. Alternatively you could encrypt your data using your application before storing it on S3 where it would remain stored in an encrypted form, for example, using a serializer&#x2F;deserializer with Hive.</p>
<p>More information on implementing SSE and CSE with EMR can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/process-encrypted-data-in-amazon-emr-with-amazon-s3-and-aws-kms/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another option is to apply encryption at the application level by encrypting the entire file. Alternatively and again at the application level you could encrypt individual fields within your data by using a standard serializer&#x2F;deserializer such as JSON for Hadoop.</p>
<p>So at a fairly high level there’re just a few mechanisms that you can choose to apply encryption at rest on EMR which, remember, is not provided by default. For more information on how to set up these different methods of encryption in detail I recommend you visit the relevant AWS documentation pages on EMR.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at another container service: RDS.</p>
<p>RDS allows you to set up a relational database using a number of different frameworks, such as MySQL, MS SQL Server, and Oracle, at cetera.</p>
<p>During the creation of your RDS database instance you have the opportunity to enable encryption on the Configure Advanced Settings screen under Database Options, Enable Encryption. By enabling encryption here you’re enabling encryption at rest for your storage, snapshots, read replicas, and your backups. Keys for all of this encryption can be managed by the AWS Key Management Service.</p>
<p>KMS utilizes the AES-256 encryption algorithm which is the same used in S3 for its server-side encryption. This encryption mechanism is completely transparent to any applications reading and writing data to the database.</p>
<p>In addition to encryption offered by RDS itself at the application level, there’re additional platform level encryption mechanisms that could be used for protecting data at rest, including Oracle and SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption, TDE. This could be used in conjunction with the method already discussed, but it would impact the performance of the database. Also, MySQL cryptographic functions. More information on this can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encryption-functions.html">here</a>. And lastly, Microsoft SQL Transact-SQL cryptographic functions. And again, you can find more information on this using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cryptographic-functions-transact-sql?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=sql-server-ver15">link</a> on the screen.</p>
<p>In comparison to EMR, encryption at rest for RDS is simplified, thanks to the built-in application level encryption option, which EMR does not have.</p>
<p>We have looked at a couple of examples for how data can be encrypted at rest with container services. Now let’s visit the abstract services. We have already covered elements of S3 when we discussed Elastic MapReduce, but there’re additional protection mechanisms offered by S3 other than server-side and client-side encryption that helps to protect your data when at rest.</p>
<p>Securing and protecting your data at rest is not always about encryption, it’s also about availability and reliability of being able to access your data. By default, S3 replicates your objects across all availability zones within the region where your data was uploaded. On a side note, S3 also supports cross-region replication, but this has to be configured manually. The automatic replication between availability zones ensures that you will still be able to access your data in the event of an availability zone outage, therefore protecting your data when at rest. It doesn’t, however, protect the data against accidental or malicious deletion. To help protect against this, S3 allows you to implement versioning on your buckets. By default this is not enabled, but once enable it cannot be disabled, only suspended.</p>
<p>S3 versioning, as the name implies, allows you to version control objects within your bucket. This allows you to recover from unintended user changes and actions, including deletions, that might occur through misuse or corruption. Enabling versioning on the bucket will keep multiple copies of the object. Each time the object changes a new version of the object is created and access the new current version. One thing to be aware of with versioning is the additional storage cost applied in S3. Storing multiple copies of the same object will use additional space and increase your storage cost.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a quick look at Glacier and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>By default, AWS Glacier encrypts data at rest using server-side encryption. For each archive created with Glacier, a new key is generated and the data is encrypted using AES-256 algorithm. AWS manages these keys, all key rotations, and the keys themselves are encrypted with a master key which is also stored and managed by AWS.</p>
<p>If you want to add another layer of protection for your data on Glacier, then you should simply encrypt the data before sending it to Glacier.</p>
<p>DynamoDB does not currently have support for any server-side encryption. This means any encryption for data at rest falls upon you to implement. It is possible to encrypt your data if you’re using Java by using an AWS client-side library for encrypting. This can be found from the AWS Labs GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Another option is to encrypt your data with an application development framework before saving and storing your data with DynamoDB.</p>
<p>As we have looked at securing data at rest for a couple of container and abstract services, let’s turn our attention now to see how we can secure data when in transit.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at RDS, a container service. When communicating with the RDS instance, for example from the application, then you can secure that communication using SSL&#x2F;TLS, Secure Sockets Layer&#x2F;Transport Layer Security, which will encrypt that data whilst in transit.</p>
<p>This is recommended if you have to abide by specific compliance and governance controls or when the data being sent to RDS is highly sensitive, perhaps containing customer information.</p>
<p>The method in which this process is carried out varies depending on which database type you have. For more information on the implementation of the encryption please visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html">link</a> on the screen.</p>
<p>If you’re using Oracle with RDS, then instead of using SSL encryption between the client and the database, you could use Oracle’s Native Network Encryption, NNE, which will encrypt all connections to and from the database. It is, however, not possible to use both SSL and NNE together for encryption, one of them must be switched off to then use the other. More information on NNE can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.Options.NetworkEncryption.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>When using EMR, there’re again a number of options. Similar to when we looked at EMR for securing data at rest on the ABS, we mentioned the following when local disk encryption was enabled in the security configuration.</p>
<p>These encryption features are also used for encrypting data in transit for Hadoop along with Hadoop MapReduce Encrypted Shuffle which uses SSL&#x2F;TLS.</p>
<p>For this course I won’t go into the full range of other in-transit encrypting methods for other big data frameworks running on EMR, but realize others do exist for Spark and Tez. And so for information on what these are and how to configure them, please refer to the relevant AWS documentation.</p>
<p>When EMR communicates with S3 or DynamoDB to transport data then this communication will be sent over an encrypted HTTPS protocol.</p>
<p>When users connect to the EMR cluster for admin purposes then it’s recommended that this is conducted over a Secure Shell, SSH, a cryptographic network protocol, encrypted connection.</p>
<p>Next, if we take a quick look at data protection for Elastic Beanstalk, it can be achieved using HTTP over SSL with signed certificates. This would allow clients to access your website and application where data will be encrypted in both directions, from the client to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. When doing so, by default, the encryption in transit will exist between the client requesting access and your Elastic Load Balancer for Elastic Beanstalk. From the ELB to your backend instances the data will then be unencrypted.</p>
<p>If you need end-to-end encryption for compliance or sensitivity reasons, then this level is possible but it will require additional configuration and implementation. For detailed instructions on how to implement this, please see the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-endtoend.html">link</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at how encryption in transit is handled for some of the abstract services starting with S3.</p>
<p>With S3 being a managed abstract service encryption in transit is managed by AWS, and so all communication with S3, whether it be from the AWS Management Console over an API, or from the AWS CLI, it will be encrypted. S3 uses HTTPS and SSL connections to encrypt any communication into and out of S3 automatically.</p>
<p>When accessing DynamoDB over the internet the only connections that should be allowed and permitted are those that use HTTPS to ensure the data is encrypted.</p>
<p>Taking a step back from container and abstract services for a moment, I want to briefly mention how data in transit is secured when using the AWS Management Console. The console uses SSL between your browser and the AWS service endpoints in addition to an X.509 certificate to authenticate the identity of the console service endpoint.</p>
<p>If using an SDK, the AWS CLI, or an AWS API call not from the AWS Management Console, then these are RESTful APIs over HTTPS. When the SSL connection is made between the two endpoints all traffic is then encrypted and protected.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture. And I know we only covered a handful of services. I hope you can see that between both container-based and abstract services there’re security features that can be used to protect your data both when in transit and at rest. There’re differences between the amount of configuration and control that you have between the different classifications, and again, this comes down to the different shared responsibility models that they operate between.</p>
<p>Coming up next we’re going to look at how the configuration of your network infrastructure can actively be used as a security layer.</p>

<h1 id="Security-Controls-Network-Segmentation"><a href="#Security-Controls-Network-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Security Controls: Network Segmentation"></a>Security Controls: Network Segmentation</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture where we are going to discuss how the configuration of your network infrastructure can help you increase security specifically for your container services. If we remember back to the lecture entitled AWS abstract and container services, where we looked at the different responsibility models, we can see that the responsibility for network traffic control lays firmly in the hands of us, the customers. As a result, we must look at the best ways to architect and secure our services and data, utilizing different network features and controls.</p>
<p>Within this lecture, we’re going to cover the following topics and how each one can help you secure container services. So we’ll be looking at subnets, both public and private, routing tables, network access control lists, known as NACLs, security groups, network address translation and bastion hosts. Let’s start out by looking at a high level at what each of these controls are, starting with public and private subnets within your VPC.</p>
<p>Firstly, what is a subnet, and what makes us subnet public or private? Subnets allow you to segment your VPC into different networks with different IP ranges, which is important both from a deployment and design perspective and also for security. Segmentation allows you to refine your security profile as appropriate for each of the services operating within each subnet. A subnet is the distinct network segment with its own IP address range within the larger VPC CIDR block. So let’s have a quick look at how these subnets look and their network diagram.</p>
<p>So we have a VPC with a network range of 10.0.0.0&#x2F;16, so that’s our VPC CIDR block. And then we have a private subnet within this with 10.0.1.0&#x2F;24 and another private subnet with an IP address range of 10.0.2.0&#x2F;24. And each subnet is in a different availability zone. It’s important to point out here that subnets cannot cross availability zones. So what is the difference between a public and a private subnet? Well, you can only have a public subnet when the following two conditions are true. Firstly, you need to have an internet gateway attached to your VPC. And secondly, you need to have a route from your subnet pointing to the outside world via the internet gateway. If both of these conditions are met, then that subnet is considered to be a public subnet. If your subnet does not meet this criteria, then you have a private subnet.</p>
<p>So if we take a look at our network diagram again to see how these controls fit in. Without an internet gateway attached to your VPC, then your VPC is at that point an isolated network, only accessible via the Management Console or the AWS CLI. By attaching an internet gateway to your VPC, it provides your VPC a gateway to the outside world. And this internet gateway is provided and managed by AWS. All we need to do is to create it and attach it to our VPC. When the internet gateway is attached, a subnet still doesn’t know it exists, as there are no routes to that internet gateway to the outside world.</p>
<p>At this point, your subnet and other subnets are still classed as private. That is why it is only when point two from the conditions I mentioned previous is true, that the subnet is then classed as a public subnet. There has to be a route. So here we can see that there’s now a route from subnet 10.0.1.0&#x2F;24 to the internet gateway via a public route table. And between the two subnets, we just have a private route. So when this public subnet is configured, traffic can then traverse in and out of your VPC public subnet and potentially beyond depending on security controls you have set up between other private subnets.</p>
<p>As we briefly mentioned, when you have more than one subnet, you can implement routing between the two network segments using route tables which are attached to the subnet itself. These route tables define which subnets can talk to which other subnets. This helps you isolate traffic between specific subnets to help increase security and by only allowing communication between subnets that needs to talk to each other. You may have submits where instances never need to send traffic to instances or services in another subnet. If so, then it’s best practice to ensure no route between these two subnets exist. Also attached to each subnet is something called a network address control list, a NACL.</p>
<p>NACLs provide a rule-based tool for controlling ingress and egress network traffic at the protocol and subnet level. In other words, NACLs monitor and filter traffic moving in and out of a network. You can attach a NACL to one or more subnets within your VPC. If you haven’t created a custom NACL, then your subnets will automatically be associated with your VPC’s default NACL, which allows all traffic to float in and out of every subnet. One point to mention is that NACLs are stateless in their design, meaning that any response traffic generated from a request will have to be specified in either the inbound or outbound rule set depending on the direction of response expected.</p>
<p>So again, if we go back to our network diagram, we can see that we have two NACLs, both a public and a private NACL, that control ingress and egress network traffic at the subnet level. Security groups are very similar to NACLs, but they work at the instance level rather than the network subnet level. AWS security groups are associated with instances and provide security at the protocol and port access level. Each security group, working much the same as a firewall, contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance. There are no deny rules like there are with NACLs. Rather, if there is no rule that explicitly permits a particular data packet, it will be dropped. Whereas NACLs are stateless by design, AWS security groups are stateful, meaning that response traffic does not need to be specified in the inbound&#x2F;outbound rule set. So if we have a quick look at our network diagram just to see the placement of our security groups, and there you can see, within our security groups, we’ve have instances that are protected by the conditions within those security groups.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at what a NAT is. From a security stance, a NAT, network address translation, essentially allows your private instances to have outgoing connectivity to the internet while at the same time blocking inbound traffic from the internet, therefore protecting your private instances. Your NAT resides within the public subnet. This is useful for allowing your private instances to access the internet for important operating system updates that may be required.</p>
<p>Lastly, at a high level, a bastion host sits within your public subnet, which should only be accessible by authorized personnel via a secure connection using SSH or RDP. Once remote connectivity is established with the bastion host, the host then acts as a jump server, allowing you to SSH or RDP to log into other instances within private subnets deeper within your network. When properly configured for the use of security groups and network ACLs, the bastion essentially acts as a bridge to your private instances via the internet. If you require remote connectivity with your private instances over the public internet, then a bastion host would be a great solution. There are many ways to secure your bastion host, and it should be locked down as much as possible, such as hardening your chosen operating system. If this is not locked down sufficiently and gets breached by a malicious user, then they could potentially gain access to your internal instances, too. Again, looking at our network diagram, we can see that our NAT instance sits within our public subnet along with our bastion host.</p>
<p>Okay. Thus far, we have looked at some of the network security controls that are available within the VPC. I now want to talk about some of the container services and how they can leverage these features to implement additional security. As before, let’s run through some of the container services mentioned previously to see the best placement within a VPC, starting with RDS.</p>
<p>As we know, RDS is a database service and as such, will often store sensitive customer data for some application. This application could be a web app which will be accessible from the internet by the general public. In this scenario, we would only want internet users to interact with the web server and not the back end infrastructure, such as the application servers, or more importantly, the database where the customer data may be stored. As a result for security concerns and possibly governance controls, your RDS instances should be located within a private subnet within your VPC, removing the exposure to the internet like we have with the public subnet. This essentially creates multiple layers within your infrastructure through the use of multiple subnets. From a network architecture perspective, a best practice approach would be to use different subnets carrying out similar functions to create different layers within your infrastructure. For example, you would have a public subnet which would act as a public internet layer. Here you may have an Elastic Load Balancer receiving incoming traffic from your web application. Next, you will have a threat protection layer where network level security appliances can intercept and analyze traffic before being sent to the next layer.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll have a web server layer. This is where your web servers will be located to manage the web communications from your users. Following this, an application layer. This is where your application will process the requests from the web servers. And finally, your database layer. And this is where your RDS instances will be located to store any data from the application processing. As you can see, by placing your RDS instances in the fifth level behind the other four layers, the likelihood of malicious users and traffic getting access to your RDS instance is significantly reduced, especially when you begin to couple this with other security features we have discussed, such as NACLs, security groups and route tables.</p>
<p>The route tables for these subnets can be configured to only allow communications with the subnets both above and below its current layer. For example, the subnet for layer three only needs to be able to communicate with layer two and four subnets. Routes to subnet one and five can be removed from the route table. For Elastic Beanstalk, we can use the same approach. Again, we are responsible for implementing the correct level of security for environments that are deployed via the Elastic Beanstalk service, which, often by design, have a multi-layered approach of web, app and database infrastructure components.</p>
<p>Grouping similar elements and spitting others into different subnets enhances the overall security of the deployment. This grouping allows you to implement other security features, such as NACLs and security groups more effectively, as the number of protocols and ports being used will be kept to a minimum, thus narrowing any room for error or malicious access. For example, an incoming NACL applied at level five subnet, the database layer, using the layered example previously discussed, may look like the following. This keeps the network firewall restricted to only those ports expected by the instances within that subnet, which, in this case, would be MySQL running on RDS.</p>
<p>In addition to this network-level security, it would be advisable to also implement security groups to add another level of security protection at the instance level. In this example, we would use VPC security groups to control this access. One security group would contain all the application servers, and another security group would contain the database instances. This would ensure that the only communication between the application servers and the database servers will be between the instances included within the respective security groups over specific ports that are defined inside the security group. It’s recommended that you define the specific ports here instead of opening up access to communicate over all TCP ports for example.</p>
<p>With RDS being a container service, platform and application management is taken care of. As a result, the need to patch the instance and perform updates on the database itself falls under the responsibility of AWS. Therefore, the need for NAT implementation is not required to perform these actions. I briefly mentioned the Elastic Beanstalk earlier, where I referenced the resources caught up to deploy your environment to run your application. Depending on your configuration, you will likely be using a number of resources between your public and private subnets. And so it’s imperative to make use of the range of network security features throughout the VPC that we’ve already mentioned.</p>
<p>Again, AWS offers the ability for Elastic Beanstalk to manage updates to your underlying platform, run a new application, such as PHP, Java, et cetera, the OS as well as the web and application server updates. By design, Elastic MapReduce automatically uses some of these VPC security features, in particular, security groups. During an EMR job flow, EMR will launch and create two different EC2 security groups. One that sets the security for the master node and the secondary security group for the slaves. This secondary security group only allows communication between the slaves and the master. The master security group allows communication between itself and the AMR service and resources, such as S3 for pulling data. As these are security groups, we have the ability to modify and change these groups as necessary. So we still have full control over security from this perspective. </p>
<p>Again, the EC2 instances used by EMR within its cluster should be located within a private subnet, especially, if the data is sensitive. This subnet would also have its own NACL. Always protect your data and services where possible within private subnets. If the data or service does not need to be access over the internet, then they should be within private subnets behind NACLs, behind route tables and not made accessible via the public subnet. If we take a quick look at our abstract services, the network security is largely taken care of by AWS as the shared responsibility model dictates. </p>
<p>Firstly, DynamoDB. DynamoDB is an abstract database service, whereas RDS is a container database service. There are some fundamental differences between the two as expected. More of DynamoDB security, operational controls and underlined maintenance falls under the responsibility of AWS. For example, DynamoDB hardware failover and data replication is taken care of by AWS automatically and does not have to be configured like it does in RDS by setting multi-AZ failover. Also with DynamoDB, you do not place a database yourself within a particular AZ or network segment, being an abstracted service. And as such, network inspections around security for DynamoDB are also managed by AWS. This approach remains the same for both S3 and SQS.</p>
<p>Network security controls and management for these services are managed by AWS and are governed by the security mechanisms impose on AWS’s own network. However, controlling who has access to these services does require you to set up the necessary authorized permissions. This is largely related to identity and access management, IAM, and this is what we will be discussing in the next lecture. So to summarize this lecture quickly, we can clearly see that there’s clear distinction between the amount of network security control we have over container services to those of abstract services. Detail, care and attention should be taken to ensure the correct level of network security is used to protect your data when using these container services. Genuinely speaking, container services offer more control, along with that is an increased effort to secure them however. Conversely, abstract services are easy to set up, as AWS is responsible for the lion’s share, but also offer less control. </p>

<h1 id="Identity-and-Access-Management"><a href="#Identity-and-Access-Management" class="headerlink" title="Identity and Access Management"></a>Identity and Access Management</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture, where we will look at how the IAM service is used to help implement security across both container and abstract services.</p>
<p>IAM is tightly integrated with both of the shared responsibility models, and both of them require you to understand the different methods of using IAM to implement the different security controls around these services.</p>
<p>This lecture will not cover how to create and setup these controls. More information on how to do this can be found within our existing courses and labs, Introduction to IAM, and Advanced Roles and Groups Management Using IAM.</p>
<p>Regardless of the service, you must be familiar with AWS IAM. This will allow you to control who has access to which services and also under which conditions. IAM policies allow you to configure conditional access. For example, configuring access only during set time periods or from a specific IP address.</p>
<p>IAM enforces multiple methods of authentication and authorization against resources within your AWS environment. Detailed information on this subject can be found in our existing course entitled Understanding of AWS Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at how IAM can help to control access to our container services, looking firstly at RDS.</p>
<p>An authenticated identity whether that be a user within your AWS account, a user from another account, another service, or even a federated user from your on-premise Microsoft active directory environment, the identity can access your RDS instance providing they have authorized permissions to do so. Using the correct permissions and access control, you are able to grant or restrict access on a granular level within RDS. For example, you can specify who can create an RDS database, who can access it, and who can run snapshots, et cetera, all through using IAM policies attached to the user, group, or role. As I said earlier, these permissions can even be based on specific conditions. For example, only to allow access at a specific time of day or from a specific IP address.</p>
<p>IAM policies are JSON formatted files. The following policy example only allows the user to create an RDS instance using the MySQL as the database engine type using the Condition parameter.</p>
<p>RDS permissions can only be given through IAM policies. There are no resource based policies that can be applied like it’s possible within S3, such as bucket policies or S3 ACL’s.</p>
<p>You must review who should have access to your database along with the correct level of permissions. Be as granular as possible when looking at data security across your databases. For improved management, create groups and roles, and apply permissions to these rather than individual users.</p>
<p>EMR also uses IAM to control access to its resources, such as the clusters and the data itself, again with policies, groups, and roles that we have already discussed. To understand the full level of access that can be granted or denied, see the EMR documentation provided by AWS.</p>
<p>By default, when an IAM user launches a new cluster, it is restricted to only that user. No other IAM users are ever to see the clusters; however, there is an option to make the cluster visible to all IAM users if required.</p>
<p>To help you manage permissions for EMR within IAM, you could always implement the AWS managed policies and assign them to users, groups, or roles. If they do not fully fit your requirements, then you can copy, edit, and customize these policies as required, which saves a lot of time and effort. And this applies to all services discussed within this lecture, and these AWS managed policies are a good source to base your permissions upon.</p>
<p>Looking at our abstract services, we can apply all of the same IAM security controls that we have already discussed; however, there are some differences worth noting. For example, when we look at S3, we can implement additional resource based access control methods, such as bucket policies and access controllers, which can specify permissions at an object level given granular access. When there are conflicting access permissions between IAM and resource based permissions, then access will be granted on a least privileged basis.</p>
<p>So, for example, the user John may have access of our IAM policy that grants access to delete objects within bucket CA-Lecture. In addition to this, there is a bucket policy attached to a bucket CA-Lecture that explicitly denies the principle John to delete objects. If John tried to delete an object within this bucket, he would be denied as access is granted based on least privileged and a denial will always take precedence over an allow.</p>
<p>As we are already aware, IAM allows you to create very specific permissions against different services for access. DynamoDB is no exception, and, in fact, with IAM, you can even grant access to specific rows within a DynamoDB table for specific users given a fine grained access control on the database itself.</p>
<p>As you can see, there isn’t a huge amount of difference between how IAM is used to manage authentication, authorization, and access control to both container and abstract services. IAM is fundamental in granting users and services access to resources within AWS.</p>
<p>This access control centers around the following components of IAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Roles, and</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding how these interact with each other is imperative in applying an effective security policy from an access control perspective. Like I mentioned earlier, we have courses on IAM that go into these details in great detail, and I highly recommend you take these courses.</p>
<p>In addition to these IAM components, other services such as S3 may have their own resource level permissions, which you should invest time into understanding in order to help you add another layer of security to your data, and this may be required for specific governance controls depending on the data being used.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture, and coming up next, we take a brief look at how some of the services have built-in functionality to help you secure your data. Understanding the services you’re working with is just as important as understanding the security features offered by other AWS services such as IAM.</p>

<h1 id="Built-in-Service-Security-Controls"><a href="#Built-in-Service-Security-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Built-in Service Security Controls"></a>Built-in Service Security Controls</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this short lecture, where we are going to take a look at a couple of the security controls that are built into different services and are available for you to configure and implement.</p>
<p>When using the service, you should look at how to correctly architect and implement the service using all of the features that are available to you, and helpful to meet your requirements. Many of the services within AWS have specialized components that can greatly enhance the security of your data. And as such, they should be explored.</p>
<p>Security of your data isn’t always about encryption or preventing people from accessing it. For example, data security also ensures that the data is available when you need to access it. This durability of your data enhances your data security.</p>
<p>RDS is able to offer durability and availability of your data. For a feature that allows you to set up your database in readiness for a failover to take place. This is an optional element to configure when you create your database, and it is called Multi-AZ, Multiple Availability Zones. By enabling Multi-AZ, RDS will automatically configure a secondary database of your primary database in a different availability zone to that of your primary. In the event of the primary database becoming unavailable, RDS will automatically update any DNS entries, and redirect database traffic to the secondary database, which will then become the primary. This significantly enhances the reliability of your data within the database, securing its availability and durability.</p>
<p>With RDS being a managed service, it also has automatic backups and snapshots. Automatic backups enables point-in-time recovery, in allowing you to specify exactly what time you want to recover from within specific customizable parameters. In addition to these automatic backups, you can also create a snapshot of your entire database, which have to be initiated by a user. Once you have a snapshot, you can move and copy this between regions and, if required, create a new database from your snapshot.</p>
<p>S3 also has a number of built-in functionalities to help protect your data, including Multi-Factor Authentication Delete, known as MFA Delete. MFA Delete enforces additional security measures to be used when an object within a bucket is set for deletion. If a user wants to delete an object, then not only does that identity have to have the required delete object access for that object or bucket, but they also have to use an additional MFA device, virtual or physical, to obtain a six-digit code to confirm the deletion.</p>
<p>In this short lecture, I just wanted to give a couple of examples of how different services, whether they are container-based, or abstract, provide additional level of security. Among all of the other security features within AWS to help protect you, remember there are also features and components that you can use within each of the services to help you add additional levels of security to your environment.</p>
<p>Understand what your services are truly capable of, and what each of their features are. The likelihood is that there are unused features that would be of benefit to your AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture. Coming up next, we will take a look at our previous lectures to summarize what we’ve learned.</p>

<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we shall briefly summarize what we have covered.</p>
<p>By now, you should understand that there are clear differences between AWS container services and Abstract services. These two classifications fall under two different shared responsibility models that offer various levels of AWS and customer management roles. It’s important to understand which model your service falls under, whether that be infrastructure, container or Abstract, as this dictates how much of a responsibility you have to manage and architect the correct level of security for your environment.</p>
<p>As a general rule, when using container based services you will have more control and operational management of the service then those of Abstract services. You’ll also have greater manipulation as to where the container service physically resides, such as within the private or public subnet, enabling you to utilize network security controls. Whereas your Abstract services will be abstracted from this environment and will be accessed over a service endpoint instead, such as S3, SQS, Glacier and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>With these Abstract services, you’ll not need to maintain the underlying network architecture, as this is a shared multi-tenancy infrastructure that AWS maintains where they enforce their own network security controls on their own managed AWS network.</p>
<p>Throughout both container and Abstract services, there are multiple ways, depending on the service, to apply security at numerous different levels. For example, ensuring security exists for data at rest, in transit, via access controls, at a network level, for data durability and reliability and many more. Much of this access can be implemented at a deep and granular level depending on the sensitivity required on the data you’re using. Some of this may be dictated by security governance and controls that may be required in your environment.</p>
<p>So to reiterate some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container services provide you with more control, operational management and security responsibility than that of Abstract services</li>
<li>Abstract services are managed and maintained by AWS more so than that of any other service classification, container or infrastructure</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities for customer differ when implementing security controls between the two classifications</li>
<li>Understand the services that your are using and ensure that you are implementing its own security features as an additional layer within your security policies</li>
<li>Whenever necessary and possible implement encryption when data is at rest and in transit</li>
<li>Use the network security features offered by the VPCs, such as NACLs, Security Groups, Route Tables, NATs, Bastion Hosts, to restrict traffic between your different network segments and to enhance the security around your container services</li>
<li>Implement a structured and managed IAM process using groups and roles to manage permissions across your AWS infrastructure ensuring access for users is restricted to only what is necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any feedback on this course, positive or negative, please do leave a comment on the course landing page. We do look at the comments in our list and your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>So that brings us to the end of this lecture and the end of the course. I hope it has given you a better understanding of AWS, Abstract and container services and that you have found it useful. Thank you for your time and good luck with your continued learning of cloud computing. Thank you.</p>
