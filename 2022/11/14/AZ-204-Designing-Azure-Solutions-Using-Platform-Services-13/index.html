<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Greetings! Welcome to the Cloud Academy Microsoft Azure Design Solutions using Platform Services course! I am delighted to have you join me on what is bound to be yet another educational and delightful adventure into the world of Microsoft Azure. </p>
<p>First I will let you know a bit about myself before I get into the course outline. My name is Jonathan. I am one of the course developers with Cloud Academy. I work professionally as a technical consultant specializing in DevOps, data engineering, and security. I am also a former high school teacher, so it is a treat to get back into teaching all you lovely people about technology.</p>
<p>So enough about me, let’s get into this course. Who is this course for exactly? This course is also for anyone looking to improve their knowledge of Azure platform solutions in the fields mentioned above. If you happen to be a software engineer, a product manager, a CTO, or just someone who happens to be trying to build a product using Microsoft Azure, then this course could save you a lot of time and money as you discover Azure’s powerful product toolset.</p>
<p>So what exactly are the prerequisites for this course then - what do I expect you to know in order to understand the material? Well, not too much actually. You don’t need to be a programmer or have a deep knowledge of computer science. The course will focus mostly on explaining Microsoft Azure systems and how to use the Azure user interface. You should have a general understanding of the domains related to each product category. You will need a basic understanding of terms like “Internet of Things,” “Machine Learning,” “Messaging Queue,” and, “File Encoder.” If you have no idea what any of these things are, this course may be premature for you.</p>
<p>The course will cover a lot of information given its short length. We are going into detail on a number of Azure services and practices. Our goal is to explain in depth each Azure service and ensure that you have a stronger understanding of which service to choose to solve a particular problem. After going through all of the content, you should have a thorough grasp of several Azure products. You should be ready to start creating products in any of the four domains described above. </p>
<p>So as you may have gathered, there are four core learning objectives - takeaways, if you will: 1. The student will have an in-depth knowledge of Azure artificial intelligence services and know when to opt for specific offerings. 2. The student will have an in-depth knowledge of Azure IoT services and know when to opt for specific offerings. 3. The student will be able to design a scalable messaging architecture using Azure services. 4. The student will have a deep understanding of Azure media services.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to encourage everyone to leave feedback. Email <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a> if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or concerns. We always appreciate people taking the time. Now without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Section-1-Introduction"><a href="#Section-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Section 1 Introduction"></a>Section 1 Introduction</h1><p>We have divided section one, focusing on AI and machine learning, into two parts. The first part will give a thorough survey of Microsoft Azure’s machine learning solutions. We’ll explain what problems each solution solves and explain in-depth how to actually use them. The second part of this section will focus on specific use-cases. We will offer several examples of problems and show how a specific Azure machine learning solution can help.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s get right into it with an overview of Azure artificial intelligence products.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Artificial-Intelligence-Services"><a href="#Azure-Artificial-Intelligence-Services" class="headerlink" title="Azure Artificial Intelligence Services"></a>Azure Artificial Intelligence Services</h1><p>‘Artificial Intelligence’ and ‘Machine Learning’ are related terms that until now I have used somewhat interchangeably. It is worth explaining the exact difference before we start talking about Azure products. Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, refers to intelligent decision making performed by non-living agents such as computers. Machine Learning, also called ML, is the science of teaching computers to improve at specific tasks by using algorithms that cause the computer to ‘learn’. With some reflection, it should become clear how AI and ML are related. Machine learning is one of the core disciplines that powers AI.</p>
<p>AI and ML power a number of software applications. Apple’s Siri personal assistant is an example of AI. She has to intelligently respond to user questions and provide useful answers. Machine learning is what powers Siri’s understanding. Siri’s understanding of language comes from training against thousands of hours of audio of human conversations. This training fuels her intelligence - her ability to understand what a human is asking for and how to properly respond.</p>
<p>With Microsoft Azure, you get a number of services that can help you to build similar systems that employ machine learning and AI. They are all listed under the Azure Artificial Intelligence category. As you can see there are several products as well as a number of command-line tools, frameworks, SDKs, and extensions. We will not go in-depth into every single offering this course. Instead, we will cover some of the most important products and then in the next lesson talk about which services solve specific problems.</p>
<p>Just to further emphasize the scope it is worth mentioning that Azure also has a large set of Analytics services (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#analytics">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#analytics</a>). These include tools like Data Catalog and Azure Stream Analytics. You can see the entire catalog using the link below. This course will only very briefly mention Azure Analytical tools where they may help differentiate use cases. In general, however, they are out of scope for this course, as data analytics is a distinct domain from AI. The science of analytics is about deriving useful information from your data. By contrast, AI is about putting that data to work in some intelligent way.</p>
<p>So for our purposes, the best place to start is with Azure Machine Learning. This is Azure’s flagship product for anything related to ML. As you can see from the diagram the Azure Machine Learning studio does A LOT. Once you import your data, you have a lot of tools for processing, cleanup, visualization, and model training. You can easily shuffle and split your data into training sets and test different learning algorithms. You also get great third party support for things like Jupyter notebooks and Hadoop.</p>
<p>Making use of Azure Machine Learning requires a solid knowledge of data science and programming. It integrates with a number of systems and APIs such as Spark, Docker, Jupyter, Kubernetes, TensorFlow, and many others. The platform itself is actually built on top of many of these systems. See the slides here for a more exhaustive list.</p>
<p>Azure also has a separate related product called Machine Learning Studio. Unlike the core Azure Machine Learning platform, Studio is a drag and drop service with a narrower focus. It is designed to simplify creating predictive tools on top of an existing data set.</p>
<p>Cloud Academy has an in-depth course focused solely on Azure Machine Learning Studio. I recommend going and checking that out if you want to get really thorough walkthroughs and explanations. For our purposes, the high level overview and diagrams should be enough to get you started.</p>
<p>Now Azure has another powerful offering in the algorithm training space called Azure Batch AI. There is a lot of overlap in Batch AI with Azure Machine Learning so to simplify we are going to focus on the differences. Batch AI, somewhat like Machine Learning Studio, is a more comprehensive ML solution. It offers ML job scheduling and resource coordination. To this end when you create a Batch AI job, it will take as an input a description of your cluster, which are the resources, and your job, which is the task. The cluster input is really just the hardware, so basically you will tell Azure how many VMs you need, what type, what disk image to use, what region, and what remote storage to access for the data. The ML job description will reference the cluster you just defined and also take other inputs such as a particular AI framework, command-line arguments, VMs, and input or output directory locations.</p>
<p>Batch AI, as the name implies, is better suited to one-off jobs of a larger scale. While it can be incorporated into a long-lived application stack, you may be better off with something more configurable such as Azure Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Azure also has a service that covers both analytics and ML for people with a background in Apache Spark. It is called Azure Databricks. Databricks is an “Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform.” It incorporates the entire set of Spark open-source APIs and services including Spark streaming, Spark ML, SparkSQL, and GraphX. So if you have some expertise with Spark or an existing Spark codebase, Databricks may be the way to go. Setup is similar to Batch AI. You go into the portal and create a Databricks workspace. You define your cluster resources and your Spark job. Clusters can be configured to live only for a set amount of time to reduce costs as well. Thus in short, Databricks is basically just “easy mode Spark” for Azure.</p>
<p>The last big offering Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services are, “a set of APIs, SDKs, and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent.” In short, Cognitive Services refers to a set of ready to use AI tools that you can add to an existing application. They include things like image classifiers for faces and text analysis tools for automatic phrase completion and search. To make use of these tools you need to create a Cognitive Services API account in the Azure portal. This is easy to do with a few clicks. You can even get a free account if your transactions are below a certain threshold per month.</p>
<p>In the final part of this section, I’ll just briefly mention some AI products with a narrower focus. There is Microsoft Genomics, a tool for people working with gene sequencing. I know precious little about genetics so I won’t even try to explain the use case. Suffice to say if you are working in that field you should check out the Microsoft Genomics documentation linked below. There is also the Azure Bot Service. This is basically a toolkit for creating interactive agents such as chatbots. You can create a wide variety of bots by training them to respond in specific ways to different inputs. The Bot Service is also serverless, so you don’t need to worry about administration, which is nice. And finally, there is also Azure Search. As the name implies this is Search as a Service.</p>
<p>So that about wraps up our discussion of Azure AI services. You should have a good broad understanding of each offering. In our next lesson, we will start talking about how to pick the right AI tool for your specific needs. See you there.</p>
<h1 id="Choosing-the-Right-A-I-Service"><a href="#Choosing-the-Right-A-I-Service" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the Right A.I. Service"></a>Choosing the Right A.I. Service</h1><p>Knowing which Azure AI service will fit your needs first requires understanding the problem you are trying to solve. While there is considerable overlap in what the different solutions can do, you can save yourself a lot of stress by picking the optimal product from the start.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some Azure AI services are quite narrow in focus. They should stand out if your needs are in that particular domain. The three I am referring to here are Azure Bot Service, Microsoft Genomics, and Azure Search. If you are looking to create a bot that interacts with users, work on sequencing genomes, or create a tool for searching heterogeneous data, then you should know where to turn.</p>
<p>The challenge comes when you have a more open-ended or nuanced problem. For example, let’s say your company has accumulated a lot of data over time and wants to see if there may be some value in analyzing it. This is a broad question that requires a deep understanding of both your business and the data itself. Which Azure data-related solution will offer the most value? Perhaps you could create some sort of facilities or office automation system using Azure Cognitive Services. Or perhaps you could make predictions about visitors to your site by using Machine Learning Studio. Or perhaps you really want to run large scale ETL operations on your data for some brand new business case or software service.</p>
<p>There is a more general point I am trying to make here with all of these hypothetical examples. Big data and machine learning are popular terms today. Often they can become solutions looking for a problem. In many cases, companies really have no practical need for investing the time and resources needed to make use of machine learning technologies, even in cases where you have relatively easy to use solutions in Microsoft Azure. So really, the first question to ask when trying to figure out which Azure AI solution to use is, “Do I actually even need to get into ML and big data analysis at all?” Smaller companies in particular can often get more value with less effort out of a few smart employees working with Excel.</p>
<p>But let’s say you have crossed that threshold and have a strong business case for digging into Azure’s more comprehensive solutions. The way to determine which tool is relevant is to first clarify your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>If you are in a very early stage where the work is exploratory meaning there is no clear desired outcome or deliverable, then what you want is something that can just give you insight into your data. This is not what Azure Machine Learning services or studio are really designed for - rather ML is more about using data to predict something. In this scenario, you do not even know what you want to predict. You would be better off using one of Azure’s many analytics services such as Data Catalog, Data Lake Analytics, Stream Analytics, or Azure Analysis Services.</p>
<p>Once you have narrowed down the problem to being of a specific type, now you can start thinking about Azure AI solutions. For example, if you know you want to make some kind of prediction by training an algorithm against data, then Azure Machine Learning is the way to go. The specific choice of whether or not to use Machine Learning Studio or not really depends on the state of your data and data science team. As Studio is a “drag and drop” system it is not going to be as flexible as Azure Machine Learning Services which gives you more control over how you prepare your data. If you are doing more resource-intensive training work on a more complex or long-range data science task, you should consider Azure Batch AI.</p>
<p>As implied early Azure Data Bricks is the best solution for ETL, especially if you have some familiarity with Spark. Lastly, Azure Cognitive services is for when you are ready to take the results of your analytical work and incorporate it into an application.</p>
<p>So to summarize, ask yourself what you are trying to do with your data. Do you want to make a prediction? Look at Machine Learning services. Do you want to transform data into some more usable form? Check out Data Bricks. Do you want to incorporate some understanding of your data into an app to make it more intelligent? Try Cognitive Services. And finally, if you are unsure of exactly what you want to do, first ask whether or not you need any AI service at all and consider using Azure Analytics Services to get a better understanding of your data.</p>
<p>So that about wraps it up for section 1. Congrats on making it this far. We’re going to continue on now with a few lessons on Azure and the Internet of Things. It should be a blast. See you there.</p>
<h1 id="Section-2-Introduction"><a href="#Section-2-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Section 2 Introduction"></a>Section 2 Introduction</h1><p>The “Internet of Things.” A curious name for a curious phenomena. It may seem like a silly meme but believe it or not, IoT, or Internet of Things, is a big deal. We’re going to talk about why it is a big deal in this section and we’re going to talk about how Azure can help you make use of it.</p>
<p>The first lesson will talk about exactly what IoT is. It is a short concept lesson. Feel free to skip if you feel like you already know it well. The second lesson will be long and dense. We’re going to go cover several different Azure technologies all related to IoT. There will be a lot of documentation links and useful diagrams. Plan accordingly. The third and final lesson in this section will be all about ensuring you understand WHEN to use which IoT service over another. Should not be too tricky.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s dive into that wonderful world of the Internet of Things.</p>
<h1 id="IoT-Concept-Explanation"><a href="#IoT-Concept-Explanation" class="headerlink" title="IoT Concept Explanation"></a>IoT Concept Explanation</h1><p>Get ready for a super short lesson that is completely skippable if you already know the subject. All we’re going to do is briefly define exactly what we mean by, “Internet of Things,” or “IoT.”</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people, when they hear the term “Internet of Things,” immediately get a very superficial image. They imagine cheesy home automation gadgets, like an internet-connected talking toaster. Due to the dubious value of many trendy items billed as “IoT,” there is an unfortunate tendency to be dismissive of the term.</p>
<p>In reality, “Internet of Things,” refers to a much more consequential and larger trend. The Internet of Things refers to a historically recent growth of internet access and network-connected devices in all manner of fields. So when we talk IoT, we’re not just talking toasters. We’re also talking about agriculture, solar power, elderly care, transportation, and manufacture. We’re talking about internet-connected cameras and audio sensors deployed by municipal police to combat crime. We’re talking about internet-connected crop watering systems that let farmers automate much of their work and generate larger crop yields. We’re talking about a massive new economic opportunity creating jobs and new fields of technological inquiry. We are talking about all of the ways cheaply adding internet access to everyday devices creates new opportunities to make our communities safer, our lives easier, and our work more intelligent and efficient.</p>
<p>IoT is not just a meme. It is one of the few truly futuristic technological developments that will push us toward living the George Jetson &#x2F; Back to the Future lifestyle we’ve all dreamed of since we were kids. IoT is a natural consequence of computers getting smaller and high-speed internet access getting cheaper. Thousands of startups are exploiting new business opportunities as a result. With the right vision, it could be a great opportunity for you as well.</p>
<p>So that is all you really need to know at the conceptual level. So now the natural question is, “Where does Azure factor into all of this?” Well, to make IoT work, you need the right software infrastructure. Azure has many tools in place to simplify setup of IoT systems. In the next lesson, we will take a thorough survey of these technologies. So if you’re ready, let’s dive in. Good luck.</p>
<h1 id="IoT-Azure-Technology-Review"><a href="#IoT-Azure-Technology-Review" class="headerlink" title="IoT Azure Technology Review"></a>IoT Azure Technology Review</h1><p>Internet of Things software infrastructure is all about messaging and events. In the next major section, we will do a deep dive on messaging infrastructure in Azure. For this section all you need to understand is that messages between IoT devices and the cloud backend are used to transmit events. These events could be temperature measurements from an IoT thermostat, humidity readings from an IoT greenhouse monitor, a configuration change for an IoT home light switch, or any other sort of data transmission.</p>
<p>So how do we handle these events efficiently? Well, you could build our own event handling system using something like Apache Kafka. If you have the expertise in-house, this could work well, but it will take time and effort.</p>
<p>Here is where Azure comes in. Azure has a number of different solutions for managing IoT events. We’re going to talk about event handling in two parts. First we’ll talk about initial event ingestion and processing. That will entail an explanation of three core Azure technologies - Azure Event Hubs, IoT Hub, and Azure Service Bus. Next, we’ll talk about actually using the ingested event data both by end users and our backend services. Relevant technologies here are Azure Notification Hub, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Event Grid.</p>
<p>So let’s start with event ingestion. Azure Service Bus, Event Grid, and IoT Hub are all capable of ingesting events - they just go about it in different ways. Service Bus is the more generalized solution. It is not strictly speaking an event ingestion system. Rather it is a managed message broker. Like Kafka or RabbitMQ, Service Bus is designed to decouple applications and services from each other with a reliable system for asynchronous state transfer.</p>
<p>Not all messages are events but all events are messages. Again, we’ll dig into the concept of messages in section three. Service Bus can do much of what IoT Hub and Event Hub can do, only it is not specialized around events or IoT. It doesn’t integrate with all of the same Azure services as well. As you can see from the documentation link, whatever your needs, Service Bus can likely accommodate you. The enterprise level support and security make it great for sensitive data like financial transactions. What’s more it has strong library support for .NET as well as Java and JMS.</p>
<p>Service Bus really shines when you need to support a variety of state transfer paradigms. Perhaps you need transactions that let you group operations together. Perhaps you need batching, or scheduled delivery of messages.</p>
<p>However this whole section is on IoT, and as we discussed IoT is focused on events. While Service Bus can serve as our main event ingestion system, it would require more development knowledge to get it to do everything we want. To make it easier for us to focus on events and in particular IoT, Azure offers IoT Hub and Event Hubs.</p>
<p>You can think of IoT Hub as a specialized version of Event Hub. Event Hubs act as the “front door” for your data. As you can see from the diagram, event data can come from a range of sources. End user devices, laptops, phones, tablets, software applications, devices, clients - all kinds of things can transmit event data. They need a place to send that data to - an endpoint essentially that speaks their language and understands the event data it is receiving.</p>
<p>So as an event ingestor Event Hub will have a few responsibilities. It has to validate that event data is properly formatted. It will use SAS tokens to identify and authenticate the event publisher. It will capture data and store it in an Azure storage service if needed. Even nicer: Event Hub can scale with your app. You control traffic using throughput units that can handle a certain number of MB per second. You can manually scale through the portal or enable auto-inflate to let Azure scale for you.</p>
<p>So what about IoT Hub? Why pick it over Event Hub? To add to your initial skepticism, know that IoT Hub is more expensive than Event Hub. So why go to the trouble and cost of using it instead of Event Hub or Service Bus? Simple: It provides functionality for IoT workloads that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p>With IoT Hub you get the ability to not only ingest data from clients but also to easily push data back to those same endpoints. This can be hugely valuable for managing IoT devices. You get access to the Azure IoT Edge system that enable on-device data processing for analytics, app changes, configuration, and security. IoT Edge in particular is very powerful from some use-cases as we’ll see in a bit. Key takeaway is that IoT Hub is like Event Hub on steroids…Magic steroids that grant powers for IoT…Anyway, see the chart for a proper feature comparison.</p>
<p>(link comparing IoT Hub and event Hubs: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs</a>)</p>
<p>So now that the event data has been ingested either using Service Bus, Event Hubs, or IoT Hubs, we want to do stuff with those events. Most likely we want to do one of two things. We either want to pass those events on to some other service to power our application or business logic, or, we want to immediately start analyzing that data directly and start deriving insights.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the former case. How can we easy mobilize all of this ingested data? Azure Event Grid is the answer. Event Grid is basically a managed intelligent routing service that consumes events in a publish-subscribe model. So take a look at the diagram here. As you can see Event Grid is basically a middle layer between your event ingestion systems and your downstream services.</p>
<p>You can see it supports Service Bus, Event hubs, and IoT Hubs as topics for ingestion. However it can also take in data from other Azure components such as Media Services and Blob Storage. The services that will then subscribe to your Event Grid will depend on your infrastructure. So for example you may have an Azure Function or an Azure Logic App that is powered by event data pulled from an Event Grid subscription. Your app then takes that event data, which may have originated from some user activity, and then return some output or value to the end user.</p>
<p>Event Grid is easy to set up using the Azure portal. All you need to do is define a topic and give it some input - perhaps your IoT Hub or Service Bus. Then on the other end you create a subscription. For something like an Azure Function this is as easy as clicking “Add Event Grid Subscription” in the top right of the UI. Event Grid can also be managed using Azure CLI tools or PowerShell.</p>
<p>Now let’s say that instead of piping our events to some other system we would rather process them directly to derive useful insights. Here is where Azure Stream Analytics comes in to save the day. If you look at the diagram you can see that, much like Event Grid, Stream Analytics act as as a kind of middleware. It takes streams of event data from Event Hubs or IoT Hub as an input, performs some processing, and then outputs to some downstream consumer.</p>
<p>Exactly what Stream Analytics will do for output will vary based on your business. You might want to save Stream Analytics outputs to a DB for storage or batch jobs. You might push the results to Service Bus, an Azure Function, or even to another Event Hub. It all depends on the type of job you are doing. The key thing that distinguishes Stream Analytics from Event Grid is the ability to visualize and utilize data immediately from the source pipeline. This is helpful when you want to make sense of telemetry data, send alerts based on sensor readings, or trigger some other backend functionality based on a real-time understanding of the data.</p>
<p>So with Event Grid and Stream Analytics we have covered how we can use event data for our purposes by either coupling events with other services or doing real time analytics. But what about if we want to use event data on the client side? How can we do useful work away from the cloud or even just interact with clients and users?</p>
<p>This is where Azure Notification Hubs and IoT Edge come in. The former is ready made smart device notification solution. Need to send push notifications to iPhones, Android phones, or tablets? Notification Hubs is your answer. The great thing about it is that it takes away a lot of the pain involved in supporting a variety of mobile devices. If you have experience as a mobile developer then you’ll really know what I am talking about. Unlike other forms of messaging, push notifications often have tricky platform-dependent logic. Scaling, managing tokens, and routing messages to different segments of users on different hardware and different versions of Android is non-trivial work for even an experienced tech team.</p>
<p>Notification Hub takes away most of that pain. It lets you broadcast to all platforms with a single interface. It can work both in the cloud or on-premises and includes security features like SAS, shared access secrets, and federated authentication. See the “How To” guide link for more details. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-aspnet-cross-platform-notification">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-aspnet-cross-platform-notification</a>)</p>
<p>Lastly we need to talk about IoT Edge. IoT Edge is a tool for empowering IoT devices. It lets you run code directly on client devices instead of in the cloud. So you can do things like change device configuration, get real-time analytical data, or detect anomalous conditions. The chief value of doing such work directly on the device is that it saves the effort of having to send event data back and forth over the internet. So for example, we might want an IoT home sensor to alert us to some unusual condition without having to phone home to the cloud to run analysis. You can imagine how valuable this could be for something like an IoT smoke detector or security system. IoT Edge can also empower devices where network connectivity is not always reliable.</p>
<p>So how exactly does IoT Edge let you run code on the device itself? It’s pretty ingenious actually. What you do is install an IoT Edge runtime on your client device. This runtime executes IoT Edge modules. These modules are just lightweight Docker containers that run whatever business logic you want. Modules can call other Azure services, run 3rd party software, or execute your own custom code. Whatever it is you need your device to do. The IoT Edge runtime will manage your modules, track module health, facilitate communication with downstream itself and other endpoints, and manage security. Best of all: You can track all of this activity in the Azure web portal. With a few clicks you can monitor device health and push updates or configuration changes. IoT Edge gives you ultimate control over your entire fleet of IoT devices.</p>
<p>IoT Edge does not integrate with Azure Event Hub. To properly make use of IoT Edge you need an IoT Hub account. Note that with the IoT Hub basic tier account, you can only use IoT Edge for testing and evaluation. You need a paid IoT Hub Standard tier account to get proper support for IoT Edge production use cases. As mentioned above this is what enables the cloud-to-device messaging that powers IoT Edge.</p>
<p>So that about wraps it up. We have gone over all of Azure’s offerings in the IoT space. You should know enough now to be dangerous. To really solidify your understanding, play around with some of these tools in the Azure portal or at least read some of the quickstart and how-to guides in the Azure documentation. So for our next section we’re going to offer some additional insight about selecting the right IoT Azure service for your particular use-case. See you there.</p>
<h1 id="IoT-Azure-Technology-Selection-Insight"><a href="#IoT-Azure-Technology-Selection-Insight" class="headerlink" title="IoT Azure Technology Selection Insight"></a>IoT Azure Technology Selection Insight</h1><p>The third and last part of our section on Azure IoT services is really meant for reinforcement. We’re not really presenting anything new about the services we discussed in the last section. Rather we’re just going to briefly talk about what differentiates the services to help you understand when to favor one solution over another.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the more specialized technologies with narrower use-cases. This covers Azure Stream Analytics, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Notification Hubs. Let’s begin with the last one. Notification Hubs, as the name implies, is for sending notifications to mobile devices. That’s basically it. Notification Hubs is a Push Engine and API for notifications. Azure Stream Analytics is your toolkit for real-time analytics on event streams. So if you are looking to gain some business insight on streams of data, that’s where to look. Finally, IoT Edge is for implementing data analysis and processing directly on your IoT devices. Basically it is a method for taking workloads off of your backend allowing you to send fewer messages back and forth.</p>
<p>So now we’re left with four key IoT services: Event Grid, Service Bus, Event Hubs, and IoT Hub. Now of these four, one of these things is not like the other. For the folks playing at home, that would be Azure Event Grid.</p>
<p>Event Grid is NOT an event ingestion or processing system. Rather it is middleware meant to help you create applications with an event-based architecture. It is designed to help connect sources of event data to different endpoints or event handlers. So for example it can take event data from Service Bus or IoT Hub and connect it to your Azure Functions to create a serverless application stack. So think of Event Grid as the glue that connects your event data and downstream applications.</p>
<p>So finally, the remaining three services, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Service Bus. All three can be used for event ingestion and processing, so how do we know which one to use?</p>
<p>I think the easiest approach is to think of them in terms of decreasing levels of specialization. So, Azure Service Bus is the most general purpose of the three. It is a cloud messaging service that can be used not only for events but any sort of asynchronous FIFO messaging system. If you are not even thinking in terms of events Service Bus may be the place to start. It also is great when you need ACID guarantees, meaning you need real transactions that are durable and won’t get dropped. This is especially important when dealing with temporal transactions with things like finance or manufacturing.</p>
<p>From there we go to Azure Event Hubs, a more specialized service than Service Bus. This is really your event “on ramp” for your entire infrastructure. It is definitely Azure’s most cost-effective and performant event handling system at scale. IoT Hub, by contrast, is more expensive and specialized even more. IoT Hub is designed specifically for IoT workflows. It allows for greater control of bidirectional events between devices and your backend system.</p>
<p>So in short, if you need something specialized for IoT and don’t have to be super tight on budget, IoT Hub is the way to go. If you need a more generalized event handling system that is extremely robust and competitively priced, go with Event Hubs. If what you really need is messaging with transactions and durability, go with Service Bus.</p>
<p>So that should about cover it all. Hopefully, now you have a clear sense of which service is best for a variety of situations. This will help for technology professionals trying to design a solution using Azure. From here we will move on to section 3 and get into the magical world of messaging. See you there.</p>
<h1 id="Section-3-Introduction"><a href="#Section-3-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Section 3 Introduction"></a>Section 3 Introduction</h1><p>We talked all about event handling in the last section and I explained that events are a type of message. Messages are the more general concept. Messages are data - encapsulations of system state transmitted electronically. They may be text, binary, or some other format.</p>
<p>Messaging infrastructure is a big field in the world of cloud-based applications. It is an integral part of most SaaS (software as a service) systems. At some point, data about the state of the system at one point will need to be transmitted to some other system. Your user signup service will need to take new account data, transmit it to some storage, and then perhaps some other service will need to use that data. How do we efficiently move data around in systems with potentially many services? How do we coordinate between services that push data somewhere and services looking to subscribe and receive data from somewhere?</p>
<p>This is the essence of messaging systems. There are numerous technologies that have come about to try to solve this issue. On the one hand you have message queues like RabbitMQ. There are also more robust systems like Apache Kafka and Ignite.</p>
<p>We’re going to cover Microsoft Azure’s messaging solutions in this section and talk about the specific use-case of push notifications on smart devices. Now, some of this will be review, as we talked about some of these solutions while covering events in the context of IoT. I will try my best to not repeat myself too much, but if you decide to watch the video at 2x speed when I am covering Azure Service Bus for a second time, I won’t be offended.</p>
<p>So before we do our technology review and go about creating a push notification system, we are going to talk a little bit about messaging more generally. If you’re ready, let’s dive in.</p>
<h1 id="Messaging-and-Push-Notifications"><a href="#Messaging-and-Push-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="Messaging and Push Notifications"></a>Messaging and Push Notifications</h1><p>Messages are one of the fundamental building blocks of software systems. So what exactly is a ‘message’? At a basic level, messages represent system state. Messages have a sender and a receiver. A typical message will be formatted with a body, representing its content, and additional metadata for things like origin, destination, authentication, authorization, timestamp, and encryption. Messages can come in the form of sensor data from an IoT device. They can come from user input on a website or game. They can be generated by an analytics pipeline outputting the results of some workflow to a downstream system. The key thing to understand is that messages represent real world information. For that reason we have to treat them carefully. We have to care about order and we can’t afford to drop them.</p>
<p>This is why software teams are so wary of making changes to servers that deal with ingesting or storing messages. If you have ever worked for a startup, you may have had this experience. Your deployment system, say Amazon Cloud Formation or something like it, is really great for stateless services that can be torn down and relaunched without losing data. But once something stateful needs an upgrade, something like a database, or Redis, or Kafka, things get sticky.</p>
<p>To reduce the pain, good messaging systems should have a few features. They should be resilient. They should be scalable. They should be capable of carefully tracking message order. They should have good security. And finally, they should be easy to integrate with various clients - both consumers and producers of messages. Now, just for clarification, by “resilient,” I mean that you need a messaging system that can survive minor failures. You want something that can be deployed on multiple servers and possibly across multiple regions. By “scalable” I mean that you need something that can process messages quickly and can be easily expanded by adding more hardware if necessary.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka meets all of these requirements. An internally developed proprietary system in theory could do. Now, happily, you can also save yourself some time by using Azure’s messaging solutions and get all of the above features right with your Azure account.</p>
<p>So now that we have some context around messaging and messaging systems, I want to briefly go over push notifications. Push notifications are messages that pop up on mobile devices, usually in the upper area. They look like SMS text messages but are transmitted via the internet only to users of the relevant app. So when you send a message to someone via Google Hangout or Facebook Messenger, the little notification that person receives is a push notification.</p>
<p>Push notifications are an integral part of any cloud based software application. They are one of the key ways we can alert users to important changes and solicit critical user feedback. Being able to create a stable, performant push notification system is an extremely useful skill if you are on a development team. And that, my friends, is precisely what we’re going to do in the coming lessons.</p>
<p>So, now that we’re all up to speed on messaging and push notifications, it’s time to take a deep dive into the world of Azure messaging solutions. Good luck and see you there.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Messaging-Technology-Review"><a href="#Azure-Messaging-Technology-Review" class="headerlink" title="Azure Messaging Technology Review"></a>Azure Messaging Technology Review</h1><p>Now that you have some context around messaging systems and push notifications we’re going to do a thorough survey of the relevant Azure solutions. Some of them you likely already know. We covered several in the previous section. Others we have covered in other Cloud Academy courses. For this lesson, we will do a short review of those technologies covered in the section on IoT. The other technologies that have not yet been introduced in this course will be covered after that.</p>
<p>So let’s start with a brief review of Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Service Bus, and Azure Notification Hubs. Azure Event Grid, as you may recall, is an intelligent event routing system. It takes, as an input, some event source, such as IoT Hubs or blob storage, and connects it to a downstream service such as Azure Functions or Logic Apps. It is not meant for message processing or ingestion but rather relaying. Azure Event Hubs, like IoT Hub, IS an event ingestion system. It can be used to ingest generic messages since events are a type of message, however, it is optimized for an event-based use case. It is designed to be extremely scalable and performant. With the right configuration, you can ingest literally millions of messages per second.</p>
<p>Now as for Azure Notification Hubs, which we talked about for IoT, we’re actually going to give it its own lesson.</p>
<p>So that leaves Service Bus for review. Azure Service Bus is probably most directly relevant to this section as it is indeed designed for generic message handling. Service Bus is more than just a queuing system that supports publish&#x2F;subscribe based approaches. As you can see in the comparison below it is a “high-value enterprise messaging” system. Similar to Kafka, it can use topics for sending and receiving messages. Topics can have multiple subscriptions making it easy to scale horizontally.</p>
<p>Now as we discussed previously Service Bus has a number of additional features that make it more robust than just a typical message queue. You get durable transactions, scheduled delivery, dead-lettering for messages that cannot be delivered - you can store and process them later - you also get client-side batching options, filtering for subscription rules to ensure downstream consumers only get specific messages, message duplicate detection, and some handy security features including role-based access control and SAS aka shared access signatures.</p>
<p>So, whew! That’s a lot that it can do. It may seem like Service Bus should then be your go-to solution for messaging with Azure. Mmm…not quite. There are tradeoffs with Service Bus that we will discuss when we start talking about the other messaging solutions later in this section.</p>
<p>One other important thing we need to cover before moving away from Service Bus is Azure Relay. This is a very important component of the Azure product line that has gone under significant change and is directly related to the Service Bus overall platform. At a high-level Azure Relay is a system for connecting corporate enterprise networks to the wider public cloud, without the need to open firewalls or make changes to corporate network infrastructure. If you have had to work with corporate network security with Windows, you may already be familiar with WCF relays - Windows Communication Foundation, that is. WCF is the legacy relay for enabling remote procedure calls securely. Azure Relay subsumes this feature and offers a second feature known as Hybrid Connections.</p>
<p>So what’s the difference between WCF and Hybrid Connections. Well to start, see the chart here. Hybrid Connections is actually an open-protocol evolution of the WCF relay approach. It can be implemented in any language with WebSockets support. Its feature set is entirely based on HTTP and WebSockets. To set it up all you need to do is define a relay namespace in your Azure account.</p>
<p>Now we don’t need to get into the nitty-gritty technical details of how Azure Relay implements all of this. The diagram should give you some idea and we’ve included a link to the documentation for people that want to know more. The key thing is to understand the problem it solves: Allowing your messaging system to safely connect traffic from the public internet to an on-premise or corporate network. (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-relay/relay-what-is-it">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-relay/relay-what-is-it</a>)</p>
<p>Now let’s get into the as yet uncovered messaging solutions. We need to talk about Azure Storage Queues, Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps.</p>
<p>Let’s take them in order. Azure Storage Queues are the most popular message queuing system within Azure. This is because of their incredible simplicity and flexibility. All you need is an Azure storage account and you can begin creating queues of work to process asynchronously. Using HTTP or HTTPS calls you can process millions of messages from a single queue. The two limitations to keep in mind are 1. The total capacity of your storage account and 2. Individual messages in a queue can only go up to 64 KB in size. Service Bus, by contrast, supports messages from 256 KB up to 1 MB in size depending on your tier. Even with these restrictions, Azure Storage Queues are usually better for most simple message queue use cases. They are simpler to configure than Service Bus and often cheaper. They also have wider library support as there are Azure storage libraries for C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, and Java, as well as PowerShell and .NET.</p>
<p>Now, one tradeoff is that Azure Storage queues do not give you the same ordering guarantees as Azure Service Bus. You get an “at least once” delivery guarantee and have to make sure your app has logic to properly order operations and transactions. For this and other reasons Storage Queues are generally better for simply managing messages within your Azure app. See the detailed comparison in the slide here. As you can see there are a number of feature differences between Storage Queues and Service Bus. So thinking about use cases, if, for example, you are dealing with backend worker processes that need to communicate with frontend services, all within an Azure infrastructure, Storage Queues would probably work fine. In this use case, the overhead of Service Bus is likely unnecessary. Once you need to start integrating with external apps and you need more guarantees and real transactions, Service Bus may be the better way to go.</p>
<p>So now let’s switch gears and talk about Azure Functions. If you’re familiar with Amazon Lambda then you already have a basic idea of Azure Functions. They are a service for executing “code on demand.” They are not a message queue or ingestion system. Rather they are for processing messages coming from some other source. So often you will have something like an Event Hub or Service Bus act as an input to an Azure Function. The function takes the message, executes some code to process it, and then outputs it to some other endpoint based on your architecture. Functions are ‘pay per use’ in terms of pricing and super easy to scale; since they are serverless, Azure will do all of the scaling for you.</p>
<p>So how do we actually use an Azure Function? The basic approach is to set triggers. As you can see here there are many kinds of triggers. A Function can be triggered by messages arriving in an Azure Storage Queue, or an Event Hub, or Service Bus. Functions can also be triggered by HTTP requests, Github webhooks, timers, and other generic types of webhooks. You get a range of options and strong integration with Azure services like Event Grid, Notification Hubs, Cosmos DB, and Azure Storage. So if you’re application logic - your startup’s “special sauce” - can be easily translated into discrete code calls to be run as an Azure Function, this may be the simplest and most scalable paradigm for message processing available.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s talk about Azure Logic Apps. Logic Apps are a tool for automating workflows in Azure. So what exactly is a workflow? Well, a workflow is just a business process broken down into a series of steps. It may involve grabbing data from storage, executing a function, posting a message somewhere, sending an alert, firing an email, etc. etc. What Logic Apps do is allow you to automate these workflows and add, surprise surprise, logic! This means you can add conditions - you can make it so that workflows only trigger after specific events. You can define logic apps using the Azure Portal or by writing JSON definitions. You can also use PowerShell.</p>
<p>Logic Apps are not for creating custom code or complete software applications from scratch. They are really for wiring together parts of your Azure infrastructure or connecting it with legacy systems. So how does this relate to messaging? Well, consider the diagram here. Your messaging system needs to do more than just ingest messages. It may need those messages to trigger additional processes. You may be able to do that with an Azure Function, but that would require writing code. With an Azure Logic App you could, for example, have a message trigger an update to a Slack chatroom by having the app monitor your blob storage. This could be set up with just a few clicks on the Azure portal. Pretty cool.</p>
<p>So that about does it for our review of Azure messaging solutions. There is A LOT of content in this lesson so don’t feel bad if you need to review it a few times. We’re going to focus in on our push notification use case in the next lesson and do some light review in the final part of the section covering scalability. See you there!</p>
<h1 id="Creating-a-Push-Notification-System"><a href="#Creating-a-Push-Notification-System" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Push Notification System"></a>Creating a Push Notification System</h1><p>There are many scenarios where you will need your application to send notifications to end users’ smart devices. It may be a fitness app that tracks how many steps we have walked and wants to let us know that we reached a daily goal. It could be a messenger app letting alerting us to a new contact request. If you have a smartphone you can surely think of many other examples.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how to set up a push notification system, we’re going to take the example of a bank application. It needs to notify users whenever they receive a deposit over a certain amount of money. The centerpiece for our system will be Azure Notification Hubs. We’re going to walk through it step by step.</p>
<p>So let’s start by considering what our backend might look like. Consider this architecture. Financial data is managed by a legacy system. We’re using Azure Service Bus to ingest messages and event data. Then there is a mobile backend that subscribes to specific topics and is responsible for pushing messages to our banking mobile app.</p>
<p>The easiest way to integrate our mobile app backend with notification hub would be to use something like Azure App Service Mobile Apps. This is an Azure Platform as a Service tool that has direct integration with notification hubs.</p>
<p>App Service mobile Apps: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-value-prop">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-value-prop</a></p>
<p>However if we want to take a more open-ended approach, the basic solution is to create a notification hub and connect it to our mobile app project. We have included a link to a detailed example for how to do that with Android. It is a little out of scope to cover how to set up an Android project, so we’re going to focus on setting up the notification hub. You can do this in the web UI by simply clicking on “create a resource,” then selecting “Web + Mobile” and finally selecting “Notification Hub.” The next menu will ask for some basic information to configure your hub, such as your Azure region, a name for the hub, and a resource group.</p>
<p>Android example: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-android-push-notification-google-fcm-get-started">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-android-push-notification-google-fcm-get-started</a></p>
<p>Once the hub exists you will need to get the connection string from the Access Policies page. This is the credential that will let your mobile backend actually connect to your hub for pushing messages. It will be part of your mobile backend code. From there, usually your code will use some library to handle transmitting the notification with relevant target details. If a library is not available for your use-case, you can use the REST API to send notification messages.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Azure notification hubs is that it makes it easy to test push notifications once you are ready. As you can see from the diagram, in the web UI you can select a platform, create a payload, and do a “test send.” If you have configured your app correctly you should see it on targeted phones running the app.</p>
<p>So that’s basically it, at a high level at least. Actually implementing all of this in a real software stack is of course more complex and requires some programming knowledge. What we wanted to demonstrate here was just problem solved by Azure Notification Hubs - namely, giving your app a centralized easily managed service for handling transmission of notifications.</p>
<p>So now we will close out this section by talking about scaling. It’s all well and good to be able to handle lots of messages with Service Bus and send notifications with Notification hub. But how do we deal with bottlenecks and sudden increases in traffic? How do we optimize our performance? Stick around for the next lesson and you’ll find out!</p>
<h1 id="Scaling-Your-Messaging-Infrastructure"><a href="#Scaling-Your-Messaging-Infrastructure" class="headerlink" title="Scaling Your Messaging Infrastructure"></a>Scaling Your Messaging Infrastructure</h1><p>Scalability is often your biggest and most critical challenge when designing cloud infrastructure. If we cannot tolerate traffic spikes or sudden growth then we have been derelict in our duty. The first place to start when addressing scalability is to identify bottlenecks. What components of our system are most vulnerable to catastrophic failure due to changes in usage patterns?</p>
<p>With the notification and messaging systems we discussed in the previous lessons, there are, at a high level, three places we want to focus: 1. Messaging and event ingestion, or, the “on-ramp” into our system. 2. Message routing, meaning getting ingested messages to the right place without latency. And 3. Message processing, meaning once we are ready to do something with our messages, be it run some code or store them somewhere, we can do that thing quickly.</p>
<p>So let’s start with message ingestion. We’ll address Azure Storage Queues and Azure Service Bus. For Storage Queues, you get Azure’s enterprise storage SLAs, which include certain performance guarantees. See the links for full details in the Azure documentation. Basically, unless you have an extremely high volume system, Azure should be able to handle your needs. Storage Queues can tolerate 20,000 messages per second per storage account at a rate of 2000 messages per second per queue.</p>
<p>With Service Bus, performance varies a bit depending on the tier you select. In both cases you will be able to handle larger message sizes than storage queues. The main difference between the Service Bus Premium and Standard tiers is in network performance. The Premium tier guarantees consistent high throughput performance at a fixed price with the ability to scale workloads up and down. With the standard tier it is “pay as you go” with variable latency and throughput. Also note that the size of individual queues with Service Bus is fixed at a maximum of 80 GB, wherease Azure Storage queues can go all the way up to 500 TB. Keep this in mind if you have an unusual use case.</p>
<p>So the basic scaling takeaway here is that with both services you get strong performance guarantees but you may need to think carefully about whether Service Bus or Storage Queues make more sense for your needs as there are key differences.</p>
<p>Now for routing messages we’re going to just briefly mention Event Grid. It has strong scalability guarantees as well and is great for serverless architectures that need to route data to various endpoints. Event Grid includes 24-hour retry with exponential backoff to give you some breathing room if there is a temporary issue with your system. You also get a throughput guarantee of support for millions of events per second. Be aware, though, that the pricing model is pay-per-event. If cost is an issue it could be cheaper to handle events with your own custom system and only pay for network bandwidth.</p>
<p>Finally, how do we scale our message processing? Well, that depends on exactly what is doing the processing. If we’re using Azure Functions, happily, we don’t need to worry about scaling - Azure will do it for us automatically as traffic increases. Be aware that you will of course be charged based on function usage. If we have some sort of app running on a VM doing the processing, then we may need to implement some form of autoscaling. Our endpoint could also be an Azure Logic Apps. See the documentation link for details on its limitations. There are http request and message size limits that are not really changeable. If your bottleneck is needing to run more actions in a logic app workflow, you can add nested workflows to get more done.</p>
<p>So that about does it for scaling. We have talked about ingesting, routing, and processing messages using Azure solutions. In many cases we get solid default guarantees from Azure. In some cases we may need to select specific service tiers or change our configuration. The nice thing is that Azure is such a mature and robust system that, unless you are Amazon or Google, you probably can get your work done with their solutions. So we will end it there for our section on messaging. Our last part of this course will focus on handling media with Azure services. See you there!</p>

<h1 id="Section-4-Introduction"><a href="#Section-4-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Section 4 Introduction"></a>Section 4 Introduction</h1><p>In the final section of the Design Solutions Using Platform Services course, we are going to focus on media - specifically video content. Video media content is notoriously tricky to work with both for developers and cloud platforms. It is more difficult to analyze than text or images. It also tends to be far larger in size and therefore more expensive to store and transmit. You also have to worry about encoding and optimizing user experience for different browsers, media players, and bandwidths.</p>
<p>With Azure, these challenges do not go away, but they are made easier to deal with by the available toolset. Azure Media Services, Microsoft’s flagship solution for dealing with media, will help you navigate most of the above challenges. We will spend a good amount of time in the next lesson covering all of its capabilities. We will also discuss Azure Video Indexer, Computer Vision API, and a few other useful products. In the last part of the section, we will go over file-based encoding thoroughly and introduce Azure Media Analytics.</p>
<p>Once you finish this section, you should be a lot less nervous about dealing with videos and streaming content on the Azure platform. So if you’re ready, let’s dive in and get started.</p>
<h1 id="Media-Technology-Review"><a href="#Media-Technology-Review" class="headerlink" title="Media Technology Review"></a>Media Technology Review</h1><p>Azure Media Services is your base of operations for managing video media. It will handle storage, encoding, and packaging video for streaming delivery. To use it you need to create an Azure Media Services account. This is as simple as a few clicks in the Azure web portal.</p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram Media Services manages video content in five parts. First, there is upload and storage for administering content at rest. Then there is the encoding step to prepare content for media players. Next is setting asset delivery policies for clarifying how content can be used. From there, content is published to an OnDemand locator, and finally, content can be streamed to clients. Mixed into those five steps are some important security decisions. In this diagram, we add those in. There is setting the encryption content key and an authorization policy. Together these allow for content to be dynamically encrypted during playback. Media Services also includes options for encrypting content at rest.</p>
<p>Azure Media Services supports a number of approaches to delivering content. You can create streaming endpoints for video content using multi-bitrate (adaptive bitrate for unstable network conditions) streams over HLS, HTTP Live Streaming, or MPEG-DASH. You can create URL endpoints for both streaming or download. It’s up to you to decide whether you want users to be able to copy your media files, play them in browsers, or stream them in smart phones and other devices.</p>
<p>Honestly, it would take its own course to cover every single thing Media Services can do. See the documentation if you really want to go down a rabbit hole. One very important thing I will leave you with regarding Media Services, however, is that you can interact with its functionality in multiple ways. Like other Azure products Media Services works with the Azure web dashboard, a REST API, and has an SDK for .NET language support. So regardless of how you want to access your Media Services account, you will always have options.</p>
<p>Now, an important related service is the Azure Video Indexer product. Video Indexer replaces the older Video API service Azure supported in the past. Video Indexer is a relatively straightforward set of tools built on top of Azure Media Analytics, which we will cover later. It is designed to extract information from videos for easier management. So for example you can use Video Indexer to do visual text recognition on a video, transcribe audio, detect faces, translate the video to another language, and much much more. See the list of features in the slide here to get a full sense. Important to note: These tools are also supported by the SDK and can be accessed using .NET or REST calls.</p>
<p>Finally, the Azure Computer Vision API is somewhat similar to the image classification tools we discussed in the section on AI. This API gives developers tools for processing images using Azure’s advanced classification algorithms. You can access the API using languages like Python, C#, Ruby, Java, and PHP, or even just use cURL. Assuming your image meets the requirements shown in the slide, you can then call the API to do things like recognize text, flag adult content, apply tags based on content, generate descriptions, detect human faces, and even recognize domain-specific content.</p>
<p>So there you have it - we have gone over most of the basic media technologies in the Azure software ecosystem. We still have one major component to cover - the Azure Media Analytics toolset. We will cover that and briefly discuss file-based encoding systems in Azure in the next lesson. See you there.</p>
<h1 id="File-Based-Encoding-and-Azure-Media-Analytics"><a href="#File-Based-Encoding-and-Azure-Media-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="File-Based Encoding and Azure Media Analytics"></a>File-Based Encoding and Azure Media Analytics</h1><p>We will wrap up our lesson on Azure Media with a discussion on media file encoding and an introduction to the Azure Media Analytics tool set.</p>
<p>We aren’t going to go super deep here with respect to compression algorithms or the history of different codecs. For our purposes you just need to know what a video codec is. It is simply a piece of software that compresses or decompresses digital media. An encoder is for compression and a decoder is for decompression, and the codec is the software doing the work. Generally when we talk about encoding we are talking about audio or video files. There are numerous formats such as mp3, wma, mp4. Some forms are lossy or lossless depending on the compression algorithms used. Lossy formats usually take far less space but will lose information over time as the file is compressed and decompressed. Lossless formats take more space but maintain their quality over time. This is why your hipster friend is really into using FLAC for his music collection.</p>
<p>So our focus is file-based encoding. File-based encoding, as you might have guessed, relies on video files. These will be the inputs and outputs for your codec software. So you will start with some raw video file taken from a camera or other source, run that through an encoding program, and the output will be a compressed version of the video that will use less space and be playable in a wide range of media players.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure has its own Encoding service. See the link below for the full list of supported input file types and output file options. Suffice to say, with Azure Encoding, you should have everything you need to get your video content properly formatted for delivery. The trickier question may be deciding which version of the service to use. Azure offers both a standard and a “Premium Workflow” version. Pause the video on this slide to get a thorough look at the feature differences. Probably the biggest advantage for Premium is the ability to apply conditional logic on file encoding. This will allow you to automate encoding rules and thereby encode large numbers of files quickly. If you only have a small number of video files to manage, the standard service may suit you just fine.</p>
<p>(List of formats: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-compare-encoders">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/previous/media-services-compare-encoders</a>)</p>
<p>In the last part of this section, with the other Azure media services and file encoding now behind us, we will talk about how to gain useful insights from our media using Azure Media Analytics. As you can see in the diagram Media Analytics works in parallel with the components responsible for encoding, streaming, and storing your media.</p>
<p>Media Analytics is actually a combination of several small tools that work together to give you useful intelligence on your video content. There is the Indexer service that makes your content searchable and helps generate closed-captioning tracks. There is the Hyperlapse service that adds video stabilization and time-lapse capability. There is an optical character recognition tool as well as a face and motion detector application. There is a tool for face redaction if needed for legal or security purposes. There are also content moderation and video summarization systems to make administration of large amounts of video content simpler.</p>
<p>Azure Media Analytics is your one stop shop for efficiently analyzing and optimizing your video library. It can save you thousands by baking together several tools that would be expensive if purchased separately.</p>
<p>So that about wraps it up for our lesson on encoding and media analytics. Congratulations. You are now an expert on media management with Azure. Great job!</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>So congratulations! You made it! Give yourself a pat on the back because it has been a long and tough ride. We went through a lot of pretty dense material so before we pop the champagne bottles, let’s take a minute to briefly review what we have accomplished.</p>
<p>We learned how to design a variety of software solutions using Azure platform services. You should now be ready to tackle a wide range of problems using Azure technologies. We focused on four broad categories: Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Messaging, and Media.</p>
<p>Recall our four learning objectives:</p>
<p>\1. The student will have an in-depth knowledge of Azure artificial intelligence services and know when to opt for specific offerings. To that end, we covered various Azure tools including Azure Machine Learning, Machine Learning Studio, Batch AI, Cognitive Services, and Databricks.</p>
<p>\2. The student will have an in-depth knowledge of Azure IoT services and know when to opt for specific offerings.  In section 2 we went deep on this, covering many services, including Azure Event Grid, Service Bus, IoT Edge, Stream Analytics, and Notification Hubs.</p>
<p>\3. The student will be able to design a scalable messaging architecture using Azure services. In what was probably the densest section we covered both the concept of messaging in software systems and how to scale. The relevant Azure technologies were Azure Service Bus, Storage Queues, and Event Hubs, some of which were covered in IoT but required a deeper dive here.</p>
<p>\4. The student will have a deep understanding of Azure media services. So, “Azure Media Services” is the name of the core Azure tool for managing video. However, we also covered media file encoding in some depth, as well as other media services including Azure Media Analytics, Computer Vision API, and Azure Video Indexer.</p>
<p>With all this information at your disposal, you should be ready to get to work on a number of different problems. Keep in mind, however, that practice makes perfect. You won’t be a true expert until you actually make use of these different technologies and learn the nuances. To be a master Azure technologist, you will need to dive in and get your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Now that you are done I’d like to invite you to send any feedback you have about the course to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. We greatly appreciate your comments, questions, and suggestions. Congratulations again on fighting through the whole course and good luck in your future endeavors.</p>
