<h1 id="What-is-Amazon-CloudWatch"><a href="#What-is-Amazon-CloudWatch" class="headerlink" title="What is Amazon CloudWatch?"></a>What is Amazon CloudWatch?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture which will provide you with a high-level overview of what Amazon CloudWatch is and does.</p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a global service that has been designed to be your window into the health and operational performance of your applications and infrastructure. It’s able to collate and present meaningful operational data from your resources allowing you to monitor and review their performance. This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of the insights that CloudWatch presents, which in turn can trigger automated responses or provide you with the opportunity and time to make manual operational changes and decisions to optimize your infrastructure if required. </p>
<p>Understanding the health and performance of your environment is one of the fundamental operations you can do to help you minimize incidents, outages and errors. As a result Amazon CloudWatch is heavily used by those in an operational role and site reliability engineers. </p>
<p>There are a wide range of components to Amazon CloudWatch, making this an extremely powerful service. Let me now run through at a high level some of these features and what they allow you to do, including CloudWatch Dashboards, CloudWatch Metrics and Anomaly Detection, CloudWatch Alarms, CloudWatch EventBridge, CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Insights.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Management console, the AWS CLI, or the PutDashboard API, you can build and customize a page using different visual widgets displaying metrics and alarms relating to your resources to form a unified view. These dashboards can then be viewed from within the AWS Management Console.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the different types of widgets you can select to build your dashboard.</p>
<p>The resources within your customized dashboard can be from multiple different regions making this a very useful feature. Being able to build your own views, you can quickly and easily design and configure different dashboards to represent the data that you need to see from a business and operational perspective. For example, you might need to view all performance metrics and alarms from resources relating to a particular project, or a specific customer. Or you might want to create a different dashboard for a specific region or application deployment. The key point is that they are fully customizable to be designed how YOU want to represent your data.  </p>
<p>For more information of selecting the right chart type to visualize data, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-visualization-how-to-convey-your-data-1112/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-visualization-how-to-convey-your-data-1112/</a></p>
<p>Once you have built your Dashboards, you can easily share them with other users, even those who may not have access to your AWS account. This allows you to share the findings gathered by CloudWatch with those who may find the results interesting and beneficial to their day-to-day operational role, but don’t necessarily require the need to access your AWS account.</p>
<p>Metrics are a key component and fundamental to the success of Amazon CloudWatch, they enable you to monitor a specific element of an application or resource over a period of time while tracking these data points. For example, the number of DiskReads or DiskWrites on an EC2 instance, these are just 2 metrics relating to EC2 that you can monitor. Different services will offer different metrics, for example, there is no DiskReads for Amazon S3 as it’s not a compute service, and so instead metrics relevant to the service are available, such as NumberOfObjects, which tracks the number of objects in a specified bucket.</p>
<p>By default when working with Amazon CloudWatch, everyone has access to a free set of Metrics, and for EC2, these are collated over a time period of 5 minutes. However, for a small fee, you can enable detailed monitoring which will allow you to gain a deeper insight by collating data across the metrics every minute. In addition to detailed monitoring, you can also create your own custom metrics for your applications, using any time-series data points that you need, but be aware that when you create a metric they are regional, meaning that any metrics created in 1 region will not be available in another.</p>
<p>CloudWatch metrics also allow you to enable a feature known as anomaly detection. This allows CloudWatch to implement machine learning algorithms against your metric data to help detect any activity that sits outside of the normal baseline parameters that are generally expected. Advance warning of this can help you detect an issue long before it becomes a production problem.</p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch Alarms tightly integrate with Metrics that I just discussed and they allow you to implement automatic actions based on specific thresholds that you can configure relating to each metric.</p>
<p>For example, you could set an alarm to activate an auto scaling operation, such as provisioning another instance if your CPUUtilization of an EC2 instance peaked at 75% for more than 5 minutes. You could also configure an alarm to send a message to an SNS Topic when the same instance drops back below the 75% threshold, causing it to come out of an ‘alarm’ state notifying engineers of the change. </p>
<p>For more information on SNS, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-sqs-sns-ses/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-sqs-sns-ses/</a></p>
<p>Speaking of Alarm states, there are 3 different states for any alarm associated with a metric, these being OK – The metric is within the defined configured threshold, ALARM – The metric has exceeded the thresholds set, and INSUFFICIENT_DATA – The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.</p>
<p>CloudWatch alarms are also easily integrated with your dashboards as well, allowing you to quickly and easily visualize the status of each alarm. When an alarm is triggered into a state of ALARM, it will turn red on your dashboard, giving a very obvious indication.</p>
<p>CloudWatch EventBridge is a feature that has evolved from an existing feature called Amazon Events. So if you have any prior experience working with CloudWatch Events then this will be fairly familiar to you.  </p>
<p>CloudWatch EventBridge provides a means of connecting your own applications to a variety of different targets, typically AWS services, to allow you to implement a level of real-time monitoring, allowing you to respond to events that occur in your application as they happen.  </p>
<p>But what is an event? Basically, an event is anything that causes a change to your environment or application.</p>
<p>The big benefit of using CloudWatch EventBridge is that it offers you the opportunity to implement a level of event-driven architecture in a real-time decoupled environment. </p>
<p>EventBridge establishes a connection between your applications and specified targets to allow a data stream of events to be sent. Currently, there is a wide range of targets that can be used as a destination for events as you can see here.</p>
<p>For the latest list of targets, please see the relevant documentation here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-targets.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-targets.html</a></p>
<p>Let me provide a quick level overview of some of the elements of this feature, and these include Rules, Targets, and Event Buses.</p>
<p>So starting with Rules. A rule acts as a filter for incoming streams of event traffic and then routes these events to the appropriate target defined within the rule. The rule itself can route traffic to multiple targets, however the target must be in the same region. </p>
<p>Next, we have Targets. We saw a list of these just a few moments ago, so targets and where the events are sent by the Rules, such as AWS Lambda, SQS, Kinesis or SNS. All events received by the target are done os in a JSON format</p>
<p>Now finally, Event Buses. An Event Bus is the component that actually receives the Event from your applications and your rules are associated with a specific event bus. CloudWatch EventBridge uses a default Event bus that is used to receive events from AWS services, however, you are able to create your own Event Bus to capture events from your own applications. </p>
<p>CloudWatch Logs gives you a centralized location to house all of your logs from different AWS services that provide logs as an output, such as CloudTrail, EC2, VPC Flow logs, etc, in addition to your own applications.</p>
<p>When log data is fed into Cloudwatch Logs you can utilize CloudWatch Log Insights to monitor the logstream in real time and configure filters to search for specific entries and actions that you need to be alerted on or respond to. This allows CloudWatch Logs to act as a central repository for real-time monitoring of log data. </p>
<p>An added advantage of CloudWatch logs comes with the installation of the Unified CloudWatch Agent, which can collect logs and additional metric data from EC2 instances as well from on-premise services running either a Linux or Windows operating system. This metric data is in addition to the default EC2 metrics that CloudWatch automatically configures for you. The list of these additional metrics collected by the agent can be found at this link <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There are now 3 different types of insights within CloudWatch, there are Log Insights, Container Insights, and Lambda Insights.</p>
<p>But what exactly are insights? Well as the name suggests, they provide the ability to get more information from the data that CloudWatch is collecting. So let’s look at each of these at a high level to understand the role that they perform, starting with Log Insights.</p>
<p>This is a feature that can analyze your logs that are captured by CloudWatch Logs at scale in seconds using interactive queries delivering visualizations that can be represented as bar, line, pie, or stacked area charts. The versatility of this feature allows you to work with any log file formats that AWS services or your applications might be using.</p>
<p>Using a flexible approach, you can use Log insights to filter your log data to retrieve specific data allowing you to gather insights that you are interested in. Also using the visual capabilities of the feature, it can display them in a visual way.</p>
<p>Much like Log insights, Container Insights allow you to collate and group different metric data from different container services and applications within AWS, for example, the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, (EKS) and the Elastic Container Service (ECS). </p>
<p>In addition to the standard metrics collected for these services by CloudWatch, Container Insights also allows you to capture and monitor diagnostic data giving you additional insights into how to resolve issues that arise within your container architecture. This monitoring and insight data can be analyzed at the cluster, node, pod, and task level making it a valuable tool to help you understand your container applications and services.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by now, this feature provides you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of your applications using AWS Lambda. Working on the principles as we have seen with the previous 2 insight features, it gathers and aggregates system and diagnostic metrics related to AWS Lambda to help you monitor and troubleshoot your serverless applications.</p>
<p>To enable Lambda Insights, you need to enable the feature per Lambda function that you create within Monitoring Tools section of your function:</p>
<p>This ensures that a CloudWatch extension is enabled for your function allowing it to collate system-level metrics which are recorded every time the function is invoked.</p>
<h1 id="CloudWatch-infrastructure-monitoring"><a href="#CloudWatch-infrastructure-monitoring" class="headerlink" title="CloudWatch - infrastructure monitoring"></a>CloudWatch - infrastructure monitoring</h1><p>Hi and welcome to our seventh lecture. In this lecture, we will take a look at Cloud Watch and explore its main features. We will also work with one of the best features of Cloud Watch, the custom metrics, where we can upload any data we want and monitor it from AWS.</p>
<p>First, we need to go to the Cloud Watch dashboard. Here, we can see the two alarms that we created in the last lecture. The low CPU utilization alarm is sending emails to the Cloud Motors admins topic.</p>
<p>We don’t want that, as this information is not critical for us. So let’s remove this notification and adjust the alarm, because after a while, we noticed that it was removing instances too soon. In the same way, let’s modify the high CPU utilization alarm, because it was also adding instances to auto scaling too soon. If you explore enough, you will notice that we could use the same alarm to trigger the increase and decrease policies that we specified in auto scaling. Let’s check the metrics. Here, we can see a list of all available metrics that we can query. We can see graphics, combine graphics with multiple metrics, or set alarms for the metrics that we see here. Depending on what you have in your environment, you could have more or less metrics to view.</p>
<p>If we select one metric, we can see a graphic with the metrics value over the time. We can also combine the current graphic with more than one metric. That way, we could, for instance, see what happens with the instance IO when the CPU utilization is high, or how the RDS database reacts when there is too much network traffic at the instances on the auto scaling group, or how many requests are being processed by ELB during the working hours. There are many possible choices. It’s up to you to combine the data and explore the possibilities. You could select the metrics that you want, build a graphic and share it. You just need to click on Copy URL and share the link.</p>
<p>You can select the exact time frame that you want to see on the graphic. But besides AWS services, Cloud Watch can also monitor how much you’re going to pay for the current month. You can also set alarms for that. You just need to go to the North Virginia region and view the billing metrics. Here you could, for instance, create a billing alarm in case you have a defined budget for your project. Since we want to save money, let’s create an alarm that will send an email to the one who’s responsible for the bills. Whenever the estimated cost is more than zero, it will trigger the alarm. In other words, we don’t want to pay anything. To really have billing alarms, you would need to first go on the billing and cost management console, click on preferences, and then select the receive billing alerts. I can’t do this since I’m not using the route account, and my IAM user doesn’t have permissions for that. Now, we are done.</p>
<p>For me, the best feature of Cloud Watch is the custom metrics that we can send and monitor as we do with any other metric.</p>
<p>I’ve written a simple script that’s available in the GitHub repository in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/cloudacademy/cloudmotors/tree/master/scripts">scripts folder</a>. Before running, you need to have the AWS command line interface configured on your machine. Since I have it already, I will skip that part and show you the script.</p>
<p>You just need to change the end point variable and allow ping on the ELS’ security group to allow it to work properly. The ping will get the latency and curl will count the time that the welcome page is taking to load. I’m running this script as we speak, and it’s sending data already.</p>
<p>Let’s check the data. And here we have our custom metrics. And we can compare them on the same graphic over a time frame as we already saw. We can also export the graphic URL as any other graphic. I strongly recommend you take some time and explore everything that Cloud Watch can provide.</p>

<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Hello and welcome to the final lecture in this course where I just want to quickly summarize what we have covered. </p>
<p>So we now know what Amazon CloudWatch is, it’s a global service designed to be your window into the health and operational performance of your applications and infrastructure. It comes complete with many different features that allow us to capture and log essential data relating to our resources and applications. </p>
<p>By creating CloudWatch Dashboards you can build and customize different visual widgets to display metrics and alarms relating to your resources to form a unified view. This provides a very quick and easy method of viewing the status of your infrastructure based on metrics you have defined.</p>
<p>CloudWatch Metrics are key to the service, they enable you to monitor a specific element of an application or resource over a period of time while tracking these data points. This can help to ensure that you are not undersizing your resources, or in fact, oversizing your resource with too much spare capacity. Different services offer different metrics, allowing you to monitor the most important performance factors for each service.</p>
<p>CloudWatch Alarms enable you to implement automatic responses and actions based on custom thresholds defined for your metrics. Alarms can be in any 1 of 3 different states, either </p>
<ul>
<li>OK – The metric is within the defined configured threshold</li>
<li>ALARM – The metric has exceeded the thresholds set </li>
<li>INSUFFICIENT_DATA – The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state</li>
</ul>
<p>By using CloudWatch EventBridge provides a means of connecting your own applications to different targets to allow you to implement a level of real-time monitoring, allowing you to respond to events that occur in your application as they happen. This offers you the opportunity to implement a level of event-driven architecture in a real-time decoupled environment. </p>
<p>CloudWatch Logs centralize your logs from different AWS services and applications allowing you to monitor them in real time and filter for specific entries and actions. They can also capture log data from your on-premise infrastructure through the use of a logging agent.</p>
<p>There are 3 different variants of CloudWatch Insights, these being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log Insights</li>
<li>Container Insights</li>
<li>Lambda Insights</li>
</ul>
<p>And they all provide the ability to collate and display more information from the data that CloudWatch is collecting. Log insights can analyze your logs at scale using interactive queries. Container insights allow you to collate and group metric data from container services such as EKS and ECS, and Lambda insights provides you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of your applications using AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course, and so you should now have a greater understanding of Amazon CloudWatch and the different features and options it can provide.</p>
<p>Feedback on our courses here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same course in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, it would be greatly appreciated if you could contact <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and good luck with your continued learning of cloud computing. Thank you.</p>
