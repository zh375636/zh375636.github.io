        <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to Managing Network and Compute Resources on Google Cloud Platform. My name is Thomas Mitchell and I’ll be taking you through this course. I’m a content author at Cloud Academy and I have over 25 years of IT experience - several of those with cloud technologies. If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is intended for IT professionals who deploy applications, monitor operations and manage enterprise solutions using Google Cloud Platform services and offerings. It’s also intended for those interested in obtaining the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/google-associate-cloud-engineer-exam-preparation-844/">Associate Cloud Engineer Certification</a>.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course you should have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/google-cloud-platform-fundamentals-54/">basic understanding of the Google Cloud Platform</a> and its offerings. We’ll kick off the first half of this course by covering the management of network resources. In this first half, you’ll learn how to add a subnet to an existing VPC and how to expand a CIDR block subnet. You’ll also learn how to reserve static internal and external IP addresses. We’ll wrap up the first half of the course by covering the different management interfaces including Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, and Cloud SDK, as they relate to network resource management.</p>
<p>The second half of the course will cover the management of Compute Engine resources. In it, you’ll learn how to manage VM instances and how to connect to them via SSH and RDP. As we progress through the second half of the course, you’ll learn how to attach a GPU to a VM instance and how to install the CUDA libraries. We’ll then cover how to view information about current running VM inventory.</p>
<p>Later on, you’ll learn how to create, view, and delete snapshots. You’ll also learn how to create images, how to view those images, and how to delete them.</p>
<p>Coming down the home stretch, you’ll learn how to work with instance groups and how to use the different management interfaces as they relate to Compute Engine management. By the time you complete this course, you’ll have a full understanding of how to manage network resources and Compute Engine resources on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. So, if you’re ready to learn how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/managing-network-resources/">manage network</a> and compute resources on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Network-Resources"><a href="#Managing-Network-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Managing Network Resources"></a>Managing Network Resources</h1><p>Welcome to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Managing Network Resources</a>. In this section, we’re going to cover several network management topics. In this section, you’ll learn how to add subnets to existing VPCs, how to expand CIDR blocks, and how to reserve static internal and external IP addresses. You’ll also learn how to perform management tasks in Cloud Shell.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson where I’ll show you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-adding-a-subnet-to-an-existing-vpc/">add a subnet to an existing VPC</a>.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Adding-a-Subnet-to-an-Existing-VPC"><a href="#DEMO-Adding-a-Subnet-to-an-Existing-VPC" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Adding a Subnet to an Existing VPC"></a>DEMO: Adding a Subnet to an Existing VPC</h1><p>Hi, everyone, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">welcome</a> to this demonstration. In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to add a subnet to an existing VPC.</p>
<p>When you create a subnet, you need to specify a name, a region, and at least a primary IP address range for the subnet. To complete this process, what you need to do is browse to the VPC networks page in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/google/">Google Cloud Platform</a> Console. From here, we need to click an existing VPC network. What this will do is show the network details page.</p>
<p>To add the subnet, click Add subnet and then provide a name for the subnet, and choose a region to deploy to. </p>
<p>From here, specify the primary IP range for the subnet. For this exercise, I’ll add a subnet with a range of 10.0.0.0&#x2F;16. As you can see here, we could enable Private Google Access for the subnet right now, if we wanted to. We can also leave it disabled for now and change it later. I’m not going to bother enabling it for this exercise, so we’ll just leave it alone. We would typically enable this option in order to allow any VMs on this network to connect to Google APIs and services, without giving those VMs external IP addresses.</p>
<p>If I needed a way to record network flows sent to and from the VM instances on this subnet, I could enable VPC flow logs right here for the subnet. VPC flow logs are generally used for network monitoring, forensics, and real-time security analysis. Since this is a lab, I’m not terribly worried about any of these things, so I’ll leave this option alone. Clicking Add down here, adds the newly configured subnet, and then what we’ll do here is refresh, and you can see my new subnet is now listed.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson, where we’ll discuss the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/expanding-a-cidr-block-subnet-to-have-more-ip-addresses/">expansion of CIDR block subnets</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Expanding-a-CIDR-Block-Subnet-to-Have-More-IP-Addresses"><a href="#Expanding-a-CIDR-Block-Subnet-to-Have-More-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="Expanding a CIDR Block Subnet to Have More IP Addresses"></a>Expanding a CIDR Block Subnet to Have More IP Addresses</h1><p>Hi everyone, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">welcome</a> back. In this lecture, we’re going to cover the expansion of a CIDR block subnet.</p>
<p>In a production environment and maybe even while sitting an exam, you may find yourself needing to expand a subnet. That being the case, it’s important that you know how to do this.</p>
<p>To expand the primary IP range of an existing subnet, you need to modify its subnet mask. By setting the mask prefix length to a smaller number, you make more addresses available on the subnet itself. If you need to expand the range of an automatically created subnet within an auto mode network, the broadest subnet mask or prefix that you can use is &#x2F;16. Using a subnet mask that’s broader than &#x2F;16 would conflict with the primary IP ranges of the other automatically created subnets. The same rule applies to a custom network that was previously an auto mode network.</p>
<p>It’s important to know that you cannot undo the expansion of the primary IP range of a subnet, nor can you shrink the primary IP range of a subnet. That being the case, you should always be conservative when expanding primary IP ranges. If you find that you need even more addresses than expected, you can always expand again later.</p>
<p>You should also be sure to factor in any IP address space of any networks that will be connected to your VPC network when expanding the subnet’s primary IP range. You need to ensure that you don’t overlap any connected IP address spaces.</p>
<p>Join me in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-expanding-a-cidr-block-subnet-to-have-more-ip-addresses/">next lesson</a> where I’ll show you how to expand a CIDR block subnet for an existing subnet within a VPC.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Expanding-a-CIDR-Block-Subnet-to-Have-More-IP-Addresses"><a href="#DEMO-Expanding-a-CIDR-Block-Subnet-to-Have-More-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Expanding a CIDR Block Subnet to Have More IP Addresses"></a>DEMO: Expanding a CIDR Block Subnet to Have More IP Addresses</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Welcome</a> back. In the last lesson, we talked about some of the details surrounding the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/expanding-a-cidr-block-subnet-to-have-more-ip-addresses/">expansion of a CIDR block subnet</a>. In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to do it.</p>
<p>On the screen here, you can see that I’m logged in to my Google Cloud Platform Console. To expand my CIDR block subnet, I need to browse over here to the VPC Networks page. Now, from this page, I can see all of my networks and subnets in my project. Now, these are going to be shown, as you can see here, in a hierarchical view. My existing subnets are shown as entries within each of the networks.</p>
<p>What I need to do here is click the name of the network that contains the subnet that I want to expand. And we’re going to expand my new subnet here. So we’ll click test-network. From this VPC Network Details page I can then click the name of the subnet in the Subnets tab so I can view the subnet’s details page.</p>
<p>Now, clicking Edit here allows me to enter a broader CIDR block in the IP address range field. I’ll change this subnet from a &#x2F;16 to a &#x2F;15. What this does is make more addresses available for devices within this subnet. So, with my new CIDR block defined here, I just have to click Save to make it active.</p>
<p>Now, just a heads up, the expansion of the primary IP range of a subnet can actually take several minutes to complete. However, traffic within the subnet will continue to flow, unaffected, during the expansion. This process creates zero downtime.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson where we’ll talk about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/reserving-static-internal-ip-addresses/">reserving IP addresses</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Reserving-Static-Internal-IP-Addresses"><a href="#Reserving-Static-Internal-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="Reserving Static Internal IP Addresses"></a>Reserving Static Internal IP Addresses</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, we’re going to talk a little bit about reserving static internal IP addresses. If you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">deploy</a> a VM instance that requires a fixed internal IP address, you can obtain a static internal IP address for it in one of two ways. You can either simply reserve a new static internal address and then assign it to the new VM instance, or you can promote an existing ephemeral internal IP address to become a static internal IP address.</p>
<p>With static internal IPs, you can reserve internal IP addresses from the private RFC 1918 IP range that’s configured within the subnet. You can then assign those reserved internal addresses to your resources as needed. Obviously, when you reserve an internal IP address, that IP address is taken out of the dynamic allocation pool. This prevents the address from being used for automatic allocations.</p>
<p>By leveraging reserved static internal IP addresses, you can ensure that the resource that is assigned the reserved address always uses the same IP address, even if the resource is deleted and recreated.</p>
<p>It’s important to note before we dive into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-reserving-static-internal-ip-addresses/">demonstration that’s up next</a>, that the reservation of a static internal IP address requires specific IAM permissions. This ensures that only authorized users can reserve static internal IP addresses. I should also note that you can only reserve up to 200 static internal IP addresses per region, by default. Another thing to keep in mind is that the reservation of static internal IP addresses is only supported for VPC networks. You can’t reserve static internal IP addresses for legacy mode networks.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Reserving-Static-Internal-IP-Addresses"><a href="#DEMO-Reserving-Static-Internal-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Reserving Static Internal IP Addresses"></a>DEMO: Reserving Static Internal IP Addresses</h1><p>Welcome back. In the last lecture, we talked about the ways that you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/reserving-static-internal-ip-addresses/">reserve a static internal IP address</a>. In this lesson, I’m going to show you how to reserve an IP address using the console.</p>
<p>Now, before we <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">get started</a> I need to point out that in order to reserve and to manage static internal IP addresses, I need to be granted the compute.networkAdmin role. I’m logged in as the admin here so I’m good there.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, you can reserve a static internal IP address before creating the resource it will be assigned to, or you can create the resource with an ephemeral internal IP address and then promote the ephemeral IP address to a static internal IP address.</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we’re going to reserve a static internal IP address and then assign it to a resource.</p>
<p>To get started, I need to identify a subnet from my VPC network that I want to work with because remember, you can only reserve IPs using a VPC network. To do this, I need to go to my VPC networks page in my GCP console here. Now, what I’ll do is I’ll use this test VPC network down here for this demonstration.</p>
<p>Next, I need to go to my VM instances page where I can create my instance and reserve the IP when I create the instance. So let’s browse over to our compute instances. And we’ll go ahead and create our instance. I’m going to call my instance myvm, and then I’ll select my regions here, along with the zone. And then from here, I need to provide the rest of the info for my instance: the size, the generation, all of that other fun stuff. I’ll leave this at the default because that’s not what I’m trying to demonstrate here. </p>
<p>Next, I need to expand the “Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy” menu down here at the bottom. And then from here, I can click on Networking to edit my networking resources.</p>
<p>Under Network interfaces here, I need to choose the subnet that I’m reserving an address for, and then we’ll select our network. Now, under Primary Internal IP here, I can choose to reserve a static IP address. But do the dropdown here, I can select reserve static internal IP address.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll give this internal IP address resource a name. I’ll just call it myinternalip. And then what we can do is we can select whether to assign an address automatically or let me choose. For this demonstration, I’ll just let it assign an address and I’ll reserve it. I’ll leave the rest of the settings here at their defaults and just minimize this dropdown. And then from here I can click Create to create my resource. And what this is going to do is spin up a new instance that’s connected to my subnet within my VPC. When it comes up, it’s going to do so with a reserved static internal IP address.</p>
<h1 id="Reserving-Static-External-IP-Addresses"><a href="#Reserving-Static-External-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="Reserving Static External IP Addresses"></a>Reserving Static External IP Addresses</h1><p>Hi, everyone, welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, we’re going to talk about reserving static external IP addresses. If you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">deploy an instance</a> that requires a static external IP address that’s never going to change, you can reserve a static external IP for that instance. You can actually reserve two different types of external IP addresses. You can reserve a regional IP address or a global IP address.</p>
<p>A regional IP address can be used by VM instances with one or more network interfaces and also by network load balancers. A global IP address can be used for global load balancers. A reserved external IP address can be assigned to a new instance during creation of the instance, or it can be assigned to an existing instance that’s already been created. You have two options when reserving a static external IP address. You can either reserve a new static external IP address and then assign it to the new VM instance, or you can promote an existing ephemeral external IP address to a static external IP address.</p>
<p>As was the case with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/reserving-static-internal-ip-addresses/">static internal addresses</a>, when you reserve an external IP address, that IP is also removed from the dynamic allocation pool so that the reserved address is never used for an automatic allocation. Reserving a static external IP address for a resource ensures that the resource that’s assigned the reserve address always uses the same external address. </p>
<p>In this next lesson, I’ll show you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-reserving-static-external-ip-addresses/">reserve a new static external IP address</a>.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Reserving-Static-External-IP-Addresses"><a href="#DEMO-Reserving-Static-External-IP-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Reserving Static External IP Addresses"></a>DEMO: Reserving Static External IP Addresses</h1><p>Hi, everyone, welcome back. In the last lesson, we covered <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/reserving-static-external-ip-addresses/">static external IP addresses</a>. In this lesson, I’m going to show you how to reserve a new static external IP address, using the Google Cloud Platform console.</p>
<p>As you can see here, I have my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">GCP console up and running</a>. To reserve my address, I need to browse to the VPC Network page, and then from there, we’ll go to External IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, let’s go out and browse here, and then hit External IP addresses. From this External IP addresses page, I can reserve my address. I’ll go ahead and click Reserve. And now I need to give my new static address a name and I need to specify the network service tier. So let me give it a name here. Hovering over the question mark here for the Premium service tier tells me that choosing this tier is going to cause traffic to traverse Google’s global backbone, entering and exiting at Google edge peering points that are closest to the use. If I hover over the question mark for the Standard option here, it tells me that traffic will enter and exit the Google network at a peering point that’s closest to the cloud region it’s either destined for or originated from.</p>
<p>Now, for this exercise, I’m going to leave this set at Premium. Now, I also need to specify whether this address needs to be IPv4 or IPv6. Now, I should note that IPv6 addresses can only be global, and they can only be used with global HTTP(S) or HTTP SSL proxy and TCP proxy load balancers. For this exercise, I’m going to leave the IP version set to IPv4. I also need to determine whether my IP address is regional or global. Now, I showed you earlier here by clicking the IPv6, that if I select IPv6 it defaults to global. Since I’m doing IPv4, we have two options here. For this exercise, I’m going to select regional here.</p>
<p>Now, since I’m reserving a regional address here, I need to specify the region to create the address in. So I’ll leave this set to us-central1. Now, what I could do here is choose a resource to actually connect this IP address to or attach this IP address to. For this exercise though, I’m just going to reserve the IP and not attach it to anything. We could always attach it later on. So to complete my reservation, I simply click the Reserve button here to reserve the IP. And at this point, I now have a regional static IP address that’s reserved. Since it’s a regional address that I’ve reserved, I can later assign it to either a VM instance or to a network load balancer.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-Management-Interfaces"><a href="#Working-with-Management-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="Working with Management Interfaces"></a>Working with Management Interfaces</h1><p>Over the last few lessons, we covered the reservation of static IP addresses using the Cloud Console. However, you can also perform these functions using the Cloud Shell. In the next lesson, I’m going to show you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-reserving-a-static-ip-address-with-cloud-shell/">how to use the Cloud Shell to reserve a static internal IP address</a> so that you can get a little bit more familiar with the use of Cloud Shell for common <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">management</a> tasks.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Reserving-a-Static-IP-Address-with-Cloud-Shell"><a href="#DEMO-Reserving-a-Static-IP-Address-with-Cloud-Shell" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Reserving a Static IP Address with Cloud Shell"></a>DEMO: Reserving a Static IP Address with Cloud Shell</h1><p>Welcome back. In this lesson, I’m going to demonstrate how to use gcloud to reserve a new static external IP address. It’s a short demo, but I wanted to familiarize you with using gcloud for typical <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">management</a> tasks, like reserving IP addresses.</p>
<p>On the screen here, you can see I’m logged into my console. What I’m going to do is click the Cloud Shell icon to launch gcloud. Once I’ve got my Cloud Shell up, I can use gcloud compute to reserve my address. What I’m going to do here is use the <code>addresses create</code> subcommand and then specify that I’m reserving a regional IP address. So what I’m going to do here is type the command out so you can see what it looks like. We’ll start with <code>gcloud, a</code>nd then we’ll go with <code>compute, a</code>nd then what we’re going to do is specify <code>addresses create</code>. Now what I need to do is give my reserved address resource a name. So I’ll call it myreservedaddress<code>, </code>and then what I need to do is specify the region I want to deploy this to. So we’ll use the <code>--region</code> flag and then we’ll specify, I guess, <code>us-central</code>. More specifically, <code>us-central1</code>. </p>
<p>Now, since I’m reserving a regional address, I don’t need to specify the IP version. If I were specifying a global address, what I would use is the <code>--ip-version-flag</code> here, and then specify either IPv4 or IPv6. Since this is a regional address that we’re reserving, the <code>--ip-version</code> flag doesn’t work so we’ll go ahead and backspace over this. And then what we’ll do is hit Enter here. Now, once this command completes, I’m left with the reserved static IP in the uscentral1 region, and if I go back into my VPC here, we can see my reserve address is now listed. It’s a static address and it’s IPv4. So that is how you reserve a static external IP address using gcloud.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Compute-Engine-Resources"><a href="#Managing-Compute-Engine-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Managing Compute Engine Resources"></a>Managing Compute Engine Resources</h1><p>Welcome to Managing Compute Engine Resources. In this section, we’re going to cover several Compute Engine <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">management</a> tasks. In this section, you’ll learn how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/managing-a-single-vm-instance/">manage VM instances</a>. You’ll learn how to start instances, stop them, and how to delete them. You’ll also learn how to edit an instance configuration. After working through Compute Engine management, you’ll learn how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-ssh-to-a-linux-instance/">connect to a VM instance via SSH</a> and via RDP.

After learning about GPUs and CUDA libraries, you’ll learn how to view current running VM inventory. We’ll then get into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/working-with-snapshots/">snapshots</a>, images, and instance groups. Join me in the next lesson where we’ll take a look at VM instance management.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-a-Single-VM-Instance"><a href="#Managing-a-Single-VM-Instance" class="headerlink" title="Managing a Single VM Instance"></a>Managing a Single VM Instance</h1><p>Hi, everyone, welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, we’re going to cover VM instance management. We’ll touch on what <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">management tasks</a> require you to stop an instance, and what happens when you stop it. So let’s jump in.</p>
<p>There will be times when you need to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-stopping-and-starting-vm-instances/">stop and restart a VM instance</a>. When you stop a VM instance, the instance shuts down the guest OS and the instance loses its application state. That said, the instance retains configured persistent disks, internal IPs, and MAC addresses. Basically, what happens when you stop an instance, is that the instance gets reset to its power-on state.</p>
<p>Stopping an instance is necessary when you need to perform many different administrative tasks. For example, if you need to change the machine type, or add and remove attached disks, you’ll need to stop the instance. You’ll also need to stop the instance if you want to change the minimum CPU platform, add or remove GPUs, or basically resize the instance.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that when you stop an instance, the Compute Engine sends an ACPI Power Off signal to the instance itself. This causes the guest operating system to perform a clean shutdown before powering off. Compute Engine will then wait a bit to allow the guest OS to finish shutting down before transitioning the instance to the terminated state.</p>
<p>Although a stopped instance incurs no charges, resources that are attached to the instance will still continue to incur charges. An example of this would be a persistent disk or an external IP address. Both resources would continue to incur charges, even after the instance is stopped, because those resources are still allocated. They don’t go away when the instance is stopped unless you reconfigure the stopped instance to not use those resources, and then delete the resources.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, I’ll show you how to use the portal to stop and start a VM instance. I’ll then show you how to stop and start the instance using gcloud.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Stopping-and-Starting-VM-Instances"><a href="#DEMO-Stopping-and-Starting-VM-Instances" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Stopping and Starting VM Instances"></a>DEMO: Stopping and Starting VM Instances</h1><p>Hi everyone, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">welcome</a> back. In this lesson, I am going to show you how to stop and start a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/managing-a-single-vm-instance/">VM Instance</a> using both the Cloud Console and gcloud. As you can see on your screen, I’m logged in to my console here. To stop a running VM, what I need to do is go to the VM Instances page in my console. So, we’ll go ahead and browse to our instances page here. From here, I simply need to choose the instance that I want to stop. So, we’ll select my VM here, and then after I’ve selected my instance, I can see at the top of the page I have the option to stop my VM. So we go ahead and click Stop, and then we’ll confirm it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, what happens when I do this is the Compute Engine sends a shutdown signal to the instance itself, which causes the OS to gracefully shut down. Compute Engine then waits a short while for this shutdown to complete, and then it terminates the VM. The terminated instance doesn’t go away; it still exists, complete with its configuration settings and instance metadata. However, it does lose any in-memory data and the virtual machine state itself. Any resources that are attached to this instance remain attached. That includes virtual NICs, persistent discs, etc. Now that my instance is stopped, I can either restart the instance or delete it. I’ll just go ahead and restart it here.</p>
<p>So that’s how you stop and start a VM using the Console. Now, if I wanted to perform the same tasks in Cloud Shell, I can do that by launching Cloud Shell from up top here. With Cloud Shell launched, I can use the <code>gcloud compute instances stop</code> command to stop my instance. To use this command, just type out what you see on the screen here and we’ll go through it right now. We’ll use <code>gcloud compute instances</code>, and then we’ll specify the <code>stop</code> command and then the name of the VM I’m stopping. Now, what I also want to do here is specify the zone that hosts my VM. So we’ll use the <code>--zone</code> flag here, and then we’ll specify <code>us-central1-a, </code>and we’ll go ahead and hit Enter here. And then we can see once I’ve executed this command, the same process begins. The OS gets shut down, and then the instance is terminated. If we wanted to start the VM using gcloud, we’d simply use the <code>start</code> command instead of <code>stop</code>. So that’s how you stop and start VMs using both the Console and gcloud.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Editing-a-VM-Configuration"><a href="#DEMO-Editing-a-VM-Configuration" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Editing a VM Configuration"></a>DEMO: Editing a VM Configuration</h1><p>Hi everyone, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">welcome</a> back. In this lecture, you’re going to learn how to edit a VM configuration. So, let’s jump right in. In a production environment, you may find yourself in a spot where you need to change the machine type of a VM or some other configuration of the instance. In this demonstration, I want to show you how to change the machine type of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-stopping-and-starting-vm-instances/">stopped instance</a>. </p>
<p>Now, as long as my instance isn’t part of an instance group, I can change the machine type without affecting the instance’s persistent disk data, SSH keys, or other instance configurations like instance metadata. However, if my instance is using an ephemeral external IP address, that IP address might change. Let’s open up my VM here. And to change the machine type here, I need to first stop my instance. I can do this via the console, via the setMachineType method in the API, or via gcloud. For this exercise, I’m going to do this in the console.</p>
<p>So let me go ahead and stop my instance here. So now that my instance is stopped, I can click the Edit button here at the top of the page. Under the Machine configuration section here, I need to choose the new machine type that I want to use. I could also create a custom machine type if I wanted to as well. Now, for this exercise, I’ll just select a new type here, and then I’ll save my changes at the bottom. At this point, I can start my instance back up using the new machine type. And that’s how you stop a VM and then edit its configuration.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-SSH-to-a-Linux-Instance"><a href="#DEMO-SSH-to-a-Linux-Instance" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: SSH to a Linux Instance"></a>DEMO: SSH to a Linux Instance</h1><p>Hi, everyone, welcome back. Since we just finished working with a Linux VM in our last lesson, I wanted to quickly show you how to connect to such a Linux VM instance using SSH through the GCP console. To SSH to a Linux instance from the console, browse to the VM Instances page, and then from the instances page, click SSH next to the VM you want to connect to.</p>
<p>When you connect to a Linux instance for the first time, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/managing-compute-engine-resources/">Compute Engine</a> generates an SSH key pair for you. This key pair, by default, is added to your project or instance metadata. However, if your account is configured to use OS login, Compute Engine stores the key with your user account. Once you’ve connected to your Linux instance, you can use the terminal to run commands on the instance like you would any other Linux VM. To disconnect from your instance, just use the exit command. And that is how you SSH to a Linux instance through the GCP console <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">on Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-SSH-to-a-Linux-Instance-via-Gcloud"><a href="#DEMO-SSH-to-a-Linux-Instance-via-Gcloud" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: SSH to a Linux Instance via Gcloud"></a>DEMO: SSH to a Linux Instance via Gcloud</h1><p>Hi, everyone. Now that you know how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-ssh-to-a-linux-instance/">connect to Linux VM via SSH through the console</a>, let me quickly show you how to SSH to a Linux instance via GCloud. To connect to a Linux VM through GCloud, launch the Cloud Shell from the upper right-hand corner of your console. Let me go ahead and expand this here. Now, once you have your console opened up here, what I’m going to do here, I’ll copy the command into the screen here so you can see what it looks like. What you’re going to do is run the GCloud compute command that you see on your screen. When you run this GCloud compute command, what you need to do is specify SSH as your method for connecting, and then what you need to do is use the <code>--project</code> flag and specify the project that holds the VM you’re going to connect to.</p>
<p>In this case, I’m using the cloud academy content team project. You’ll also need to use the <code>--zone</code> flag to specify the zone that hosts your VM as well. And then lastly, specify the name of the VM that you want to connect to. So, let me go ahead and hit enter here to run this command. Now, when I run this command, I’m prompted for a passphrase for the key that is stored for my instance. If this was my first time connecting, GCP would have created a key pair along with a passphrase that I set to protect my connection. Since I’ve already connected to this VM previously, I just need to specify the passphrase that I set up earlier when I first connected to it. So, I’ll go ahead and enter that in here. And as you can see here, I’m now sitting at a command prompt and can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">manage</a> my VM like any other Linux machine.</p>
<h1 id="Attaching-a-GPU-to-a-New-Instance-and-Installing-CUDA-Libraries"><a href="#Attaching-a-GPU-to-a-New-Instance-and-Installing-CUDA-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Attaching a GPU to a New Instance and Installing CUDA Libraries"></a>Attaching a GPU to a New Instance and Installing CUDA Libraries</h1><p>Hi, everyone. Welcome back. In this lecture, I’m going to talk a little bit about graphics processing units, or GPUs. Google Compute Engine provides GPUs that you can add to VM instances. These GPUs are typically used to accelerate certain workloads that are run on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">compute</a> instances. Workloads like data processing and machine learning are the types of workloads that benefit most from the use of GPUs. If you plan to create a compute instance that will leverage a GPU, you need to be sure that you choose which boot disk image that you’re going to use for that instance. You also need to install the appropriate GPU driver on the instance. Some images like the Deep Learning VM images already have GPU drivers pre-installed, and they include packages like TensorFLow and PyTorch. Many public images, however, might require unique GPU drivers. Ultimately, you need to make sure that you identify what drivers you need for your images when leveraging GPUs. </p>
<p>Before you attempt to attach a GPU to an instance, you should check your quotas page to ensure there are enough GPUs available within your project. You can, of course, always request a quota increase if there are not enough available. Whenever you provision an instance that includes a GPU, you need to ensure that you can configure the instance to terminate on host maintenance. This is because an instance with a GPU attached cannot live migrate. It cannot live migrate because the instance, under the covers, is assigned to specific hardware devices. So keep that in mind when working with GPUs. In the next lesson, I’m going to show you how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/demo-attaching-a-gpu-and-installing-cuda-libraries/">attach a GPU</a> to an existing compute instance. I’ll also show you how to install the necessary CUDA libraries to support the GPU.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Attaching-a-GPU-and-Installing-CUDA-Libraries"><a href="#DEMO-Attaching-a-GPU-and-Installing-CUDA-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Attaching a GPU and Installing CUDA Libraries"></a>DEMO: Attaching a GPU and Installing CUDA Libraries</h1><p>Hi, everyone. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Welcome</a> back. In this lesson, I’m going to demonstrate how to add a GPU to an existing VM instance. So, let’s get started. What I’m going to do here is browse to my VM instance called MyInstance. Now, notice here that my VM instance is currently stopped. I can’t add a GPU to a running instance. Also, before I add a GPU, I need to change its host maintenance setting so that it terminates rather than live migrates. So what I need to do here is click Edit at the top and then scroll down here and set the “on host maintenance” option to “terminate”.</p>
<p>In the Machine configuration section up top here, I need to click on the CPU platform and GPU link. Clicking Add GPU here displays a list of available GPUs. As you can see here, clicking the GPU Type dropdown displays four different types of GPU that are available. I can also select the number of GPUs in the Number of GPUs dropdown. What I’m going to do here is choose the Tesla K80 and select one as the number of GPUs that we’re going to install. At the bottom of the instance page here, I can click Save to apply my changes. What this does is attach the GPU to my VM. I can now start my instance with my GPU attached.</p>
<p>Once this VM comes up, I can RDP to it and install the GPU driver so Windows can use it. To RDP to my VM, I just have to download the RDP file here. I can then use it to connect to my instance. At this point, I’m logged in to my VM. Now, for most driver installs on Windows machines, you’ll obtain drivers by installing the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. I should also note that on Windows Server instances like this one, you <em>must</em> install the driver manually. I say this because on other instances you can also script the install. So, to manually install the drivers here, I’m going to download the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit on this instance where I’ve installed or attached the new GPU. To download this toolkit, I need to open my browser here and browse to the NVIDIA developer site here. So, it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;cuda-toolkit</a>. And then from here, I’ll download the toolkit and then I’ll select my OS, the architecture, and then my server.</p>
<p>Now, I can also install from network or local. The local downloads the entire package whereas the network package is a smaller installer and what it does is it pulls the information - or the bits - from the internet as needed. So we’ll go ahead and use this option here, and then we’ll download it. Now, with the installer downloaded, I have to launch it just like any other installer, and I just have to work through the wizard here. Now, what the CUDA toolkit is doing here is checking my system for compatibility with the toolkit and the drivers included with it. So what I’ll do here is agree to the licensing agreement, and then we can do an express or a custom installer. I’m just going to do the express here so it overwrites any current display drivers and installs the correct driver for my GPU. </p>
<p>Now, what this CUDA Visual Studio integration screen is telling me is that there are no supported versions of Visual Studio installed on my VM. Some components of the CUDA toolkit require it so what I’m going to do before I continue my installation here, I’m going to click on the Visual Studio link here. We’ll cancel out of this installer and we’ll download Visual Studio here, and we’ll save it. And let’s install this first. And we’ll just work through the wizard here, and this process doesn’t take too long, just a few moments. And we’re just concerned about the core editor here so we’ll click install. We don’t need to install any workloads. And this part of the Visual Studio installation takes a few minutes to complete. It’s not too terrible. And we’re going to uncheck the start after installation here. And we now have our Visual Studio installed so we’ll close this out and we’ll go back into our downloads and relaunch our CUDA install here. </p>
<p>And again we’ll go through the system compatibility check. With our system check complete we can agree to the license agreement again, and then we’ll choose the express option and then the installer will prepare for the installation. Once it finishes preparation it begins the download of the rest of the installation packages that are needed. If you remember back when we downloaded the installer, we downloaded the network-based installer so now it’s pulling down the installation packages it needs. And then at this point, it begins the installation, and we can see here it’s now installing the graphics driver which is what we’re looking for. As you can see, the installation of these CUDA libraries can take quite a while, especially when you’re doing the minimized download. You can speed things up on the backend of this install by completing the full download or the local download, but instead, we chose the network version. </p>
<p>So we’ll let this run and then when it completes we’ll confirm that our graphics driver has been installed correctly, and then we can go ahead and click Next to finish the installation. After the installer finishes, I just need to verify that the GPU driver’s installed correctly. I can do this by looking at the GPU in device manager so let’s pull device manager up. And let’s go over to display adapters here and we can see NVIDIA Tesla K80 is listed. If we look at the properties here, we can see the driver provider is in fact NVIDIA. As long as there are no error icons floating around, I can confirm that everything installed correctly, and with that, my GPU is now functioning on my VM instance.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-Snapshots"><a href="#Working-with-Snapshots" class="headerlink" title="Working with Snapshots"></a>Working with Snapshots</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, I’m going to explain what snapshots are and what they’re used for. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">On Google Cloud Platform</a> you can use snapshots to backup zonal persistent disks and regional persistent disks. A snapshot is an exact copy of a disk as it exists at a specific point in time and it can even be taken while reads and writes are happening to the disk being snapshotted. </p>
<p>Snapshotting a disk is like stopping the disk head while the disk is in use and then copying all the sectors from the disk. Because snapshots are so easy to use, they’re an appealing backup solution for VM instances. By scheduling snapshots on a regular basis, you can ensure you never have to deal with lost data.</p>
<p>When working with snapshots, it’s important to note that they are incremental and they are automatically compressed. What this means is that the first successful snapshot of a persistent disk is, in fact, a full snapshot. It contains all the data that resides on the persistent disk being snapshotted. However, the second snapshot only contains new data that’s been written to the disk since the first snapshot. The second snapshot will also contain existing data that’s been modified since the first snapshot. Although the second snapshot doesn’t contain any data from the first, the second snapshot <em>does</em> contain pointer references to the first snapshot for any unchanged data that’s contained in the first snapshot.</p>
<p>If you take a third snapshot, that third snapshot will contain any new or changed data since the second snapshot. Instead of including unchanged data from the first two snapshots, the third one will contain pointer references to blocks in the first two snapshots for any unchanged data. This process repeats itself for any subsequent snapshots that you take.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-and-Viewing-Snapshots"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-and-Viewing-Snapshots" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating and Viewing Snapshots"></a>DEMO: Creating and Viewing Snapshots</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lesson. In this lesson, I am going to perform a demonstration that shows you how to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/working-with-snapshots/">snapshot</a> of a regional persistent disk in the Google Cloud Console. So, let’s jump right in.</p>
<p>On the screen here, you’ll see that I’m logged in to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">my GCP console</a>. To create a snapshot, I need to browse to Compute Engine and then to Snapshots. From this Snapshots page, I can begin the process by clicking Create Snapshot at the top here. I need to give my snapshot a name. If I hover over the question mark here, it tells me the name that I use must start with a lower case letter and it must be followed up with up to 62 additional lower case letters, numbers or hyphens. The name that I use cannot end in a hyphen. I’ll call this snapshot “mysnapshot”. The description here is optional, so I’ll just leave it blank for this exercise.</p>
<p>Using the Source Disk dropdown here, I can choose the disk that I want to snapshot. I’m going to snapshot myvm here. In this Location section here, I need to tell GCP where to store my snapshot. I also have to decide if I want to store it in one region or if I want to make the snapshot multi-region. A region is a specific geographical place, like London, for example. A multi-region is a large geographical area, like the United States, for example, that contains two or more geographic places. If I choose multi-region here, my snapshot becomes geo-redundant. I’ll leave these options at their defaults here and, as a result, my snapshot is going to be stored in the same location as my source disk that I’m snapshotting.</p>
<p>Under Labels here, I can add a label if I want to. You would typically use labels to organize your environment. I’m not going to bother here. At this point, I can click Create to create my snapshot. Now obviously, my snapshot can take a little while to create, so we’ll let this complete. After my snapshot is created, I can click on it from my list of snapshots. In here I can view the details of my snapshot.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-Images"><a href="#Working-with-Images" class="headerlink" title="Working with Images"></a>Working with Images</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, I’m going to explain what images are and what they’re used for. An image provides the base operating environment for applications to run on a Compute instance. You can use images to archive application versions for disaster recovery, and even to roll back an instance. After registering an image, the image can be used to create one or more exact replicas of the original disk. You can use operating system images to create boot disks for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Compute instances</a>. </p>
<p>There are two types of images available. They include public images and custom images. Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source communities, and even some other third-party vendors. All GCP projects have access to public images so they can be used to create instances. There are many pre-configured public images available in Compute Engine that have compatible Linux operating systems and Windows operating systems. These systems images can be used to create and start instances.</p>
<p>When you use an image, Compute Engine will create a persistent boot disk for each instance that you spin up, using your chosen image. By default, the boot disk that is created will be the same size as the image that was used. In situations where you need a persistent boot disk that’s larger than the image used, you can always resize the boot disk later. While most public images are available at no additional cost, some premium images will result in additional costs to your instances. </p>
<p>Custom images are available only to your project. Custom images can be created from boot disks and even from other images. After creating a custom image, you can use it to create an instance. You can use a custom image to import a boot disk image from an on-prem machine into Compute Engine. You can also use custom images to import virtual disks from existing virtual machines that are running in your environment. A custom image that’s imported into Compute Engine will not add any additional cost to your instances. However, it will incur an image storage charge, as long as you keep the custom image in your project.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Creating-and-Using-Images"><a href="#DEMO-Creating-and-Using-Images" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Creating and Using Images"></a>DEMO: Creating and Using Images</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Welcome</a> back. In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to create an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/working-with-images/">image</a> from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/working-with-snapshots/">snapshot</a> that we took earlier.</p>
<p>To create my image, I need to browse to Images within Compute Engine. This Images page that I’m taken to displays all existing images. I can begin the image creation process by clicking Create Image at the top of the page here. On the Create an Image page, I need to provide a name for my image, so I’ll call this “myimage”. From this Source dropdown box here, I need to specify the source for my image. This can be a persistent disk, a snapshot, another image, a cloud storage file, or even a virtual disk like a VHD or VMDK file. I’m going to choose the snapshot option, and then specify the snapshot that I created earlier.</p>
<p>Now, as was the case with the snapshot, I have to specify a location, and whether I want my image to be regional or multi-regional. I’ll leave these at their defaults for this exercise. Doing this causes Compute Engine to store my image in the multi-region closest to my image’s source location. The optional Family field here lets me specify the family for my image. Specifying a family causes the latest, non-deprecated image in the family to be used. I’m not using a family here, so I’ll leave this blank. I can also provide an optional description for my image as well. I’ll leave this blank, and I can also label it if I wish to. </p>
<p>Under this encryption section, GCP tells me that the data is encrypted automatically. However, I have a few different options for my encryption key management. I can accept the default and let Google manage the key, I can specify the customer-managed key option, or I can choose the customer-supplied key option. If I select customer-managed, I need to select a customer-managed key that already exists. Choosing the customer-supplied option requires me to provide an actual key. For this exercise, I’ll use the first option to allow Google to handle things. With all my choices configured, I can now click Create to create my image. Once my image is created, I can view its details from the Images page here. And that is how you create an image from a snapshot using the Google Cloud Platform console.</p>
<h1 id="Instance-Groups"><a href="#Instance-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Instance Groups"></a>Instance Groups</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, I’m going to talk about instance groups. An instance group is actually a collection of VM instances. The key advantage of an instance group, however, is the ability to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">manage</a> all of the instances as a single entity. Google Compute Engine offers two kinds of VM instance groups. They include managed instance groups, or MIGs, and unmanaged instance groups.</p>
<p>Using a managed instance group allows you to run applications on several identically configured virtual machines. Additionally, a managed instance group offers several automated services such as autoscaling, auto-healing, regional deployment, and auto updating. By leveraging the many automated services that are offered by a managed instance group, you can make workload scalable and highly available.</p>
<p>Typically you’d want to use a managed instance group for stateless workloads, like maybe a website frontend. Managed instance groups are also a good choice for high-performance workloads and batch workloads, such as image processing from a queue. It’s important to note that each VM instance within a managed instance group is created from an instance template. If you prefer - or need - to load balance apps across a fleet of virtual machines that you need to manage yourself, you might want to consider unmanaged instance groups.</p>
<p>An unmanaged instance group contains multiple heterogeneous VM instances. You can, as needed, add and remove instances from the group. As you would expect, an unmanaged instance group does not offer any of the features that a managed instance group provides. You get no autoscaling, no auto-healing, and no rolling update support. As a rule of thumb, you should only consider using unmanaged instance groups if you need to apply load balancing to groups of heterogeneous instances, or if you need to manage the instances within the group yourself.</p>
<h1 id="Instance-Templates"><a href="#Instance-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Instance Templates"></a>Instance Templates</h1><p>Hi, everyone, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, we’re going to cover instance templates. Instance templates are used to create VM instances and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">manage</a> instance groups. When you create an instance template, what you’re really doing is defining the machine type, the boot disk image, the container image, if necessary, any labels, and any other properties that will be used to deploy your instance or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/instance-groups/">instance group</a>.</p>
<p>Once the instance template settings are defined, you can use the template to create either a managed instance group or to create individual VM instances. The purpose of an instance template is to facilitate the creation of identically configured instances. That being the case, it’s not possible to update or change an existing instance template once it’s been created. If you need to make changes to a configuration, you need to create a new instance template.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that instance templates are global resources; they are not bound to a specific zone nor to a specific region. However, when you create an instance template, you may need to specify some zonal resources. This, in essence, restricts the template to whatever zone in which those zonal resources reside. For example, if an instance template includes a persistent disk from the US-Central-1A zone, you won’t be able to use that instance template in any other zone since the disk exists only in zone US-Central-1A.</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson where I’ll show you how to create and assign an instance template.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Create-and-Assign-an-Instance-Template"><a href="#DEMO-Create-and-Assign-an-Instance-Template" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Create and Assign an Instance Template"></a>DEMO: Create and Assign an Instance Template</h1><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/introduction/">Welcome</a> back and welcome to this demonstration. You can create <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/instance-templates/">instance templates</a> through the Google Cloud Platform Console, the gcloud compute tool or through the API. In this demonstration, I am going to show you how to create an instance template via the console.</p>
<p>To create my instance template, I need to browse to Compute Engine and then to Instance Templates. So, let’s go ahead and browse here. This Instance Templates page shows all existing instance templates that have been created. To begin the creation of my instance template, I just have to click Create Instance Template up here at the top. From this Create an instance template page, I can provide the specifics for my template. I can either accept the default values or I can provide specifics as necessary. </p>
<p>In a default configuration, the machine type is set to n-1standard-1 and the boot disc image is set to the latest Debian image. The disk itself is a standard persistent disk that’s 10GB in size. If I click down here on “Management, security, disks, network, sole tenancy” and look at the network settings, I can see here that the image connects to the default network and is assigned an ephemeral IP address. </p>
<p>If we bounce over to Disks, here, I can see that I can add more disks to my instance template, if necessary. Other optional settings are accessed via the Management tab, the Security tab and via the Sole Tenancy tab. If I click Equivalent REST at the bottom of the page here, I can see the REST requests body which includes the JSON representation of my instance template. If I click “command line” here, it shows me how to create my template via the gcloud command line using parameters I’ve chosen. I can even click “run in Cloud Shell” here to create my template in Cloud Shell using these parameters.</p>
<p>For this exercise though I’m just going to close this out and then I’m going to click Create down here at the bottom to create my instance template. With my instance template created here, I can now view it in this instance templates page. I can also click the ellipses over here at the right, and then from here I can either create a VM from my instance template or create an instance group from my instance template. What I’ll do here is just show you what happens when I click Create VM from my instance template.</p>
<p>We can see here we have the source template. And then we can configure our VM with whatever settings we need, or we can just leave the settings as they are, as they were configured in the instance template. And then again we just go through, click Create to spin up our VM based on the instance template that we created.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/managing-networking-and-compute-resources-on-google-cloud-platform/instance-templates/">manage networking and compute resources on Google Cloud Platform</a>.
