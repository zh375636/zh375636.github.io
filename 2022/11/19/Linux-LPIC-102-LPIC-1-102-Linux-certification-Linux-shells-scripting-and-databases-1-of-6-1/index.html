<h1 id="Course-introduction"><a href="#Course-introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course introduction"></a>Course introduction</h1><p>With this sixth course in Cloud Academy’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/linux-certification-lpic-1-8/">Linux Certification Series</a> we’re going to encounter the first content that’s part of the LPIC-1 102 exam. The 102 is the second and final exam you’ll need to pass in order to earn your LPIC certification. But it’s also a terrific way to make sure that you’ve covered all the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/cloud-fundamentals/">skills</a> that you’ll need to be an effective system administrator, or as the LPIC calls Server Professional.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this course we’ll learn how to closely manage <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/working-with-linux-shells-1/">shell</a> sessions to leverage the full range of Linux system features. We’ll dive head first into scripting, the task automation platform which lets you apply<br>the logic and versatility of programming languages to the immediacy and high level control of the command line. And we’ll learn how to create and administer simple database installations using MySQL.</p>
<p>Finally we’ll learn how to connect to an Amazon RDS MySQL instance in the cloud and then my grade A local MySQL database into our cloud instance. This last topic may not be required for the LPIC exam, but you’ll be amazed how easily it can be done and it’s fun.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-Linux-shells"><a href="#Working-with-Linux-shells" class="headerlink" title="Working with Linux shells"></a>Working with Linux shells</h1><p>While discussing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/course-introduction-25/">Linux</a> Shell Environment in this video, we’re going to touch on three topics. How to control environment profiles for both login and non-login shell sessions. How to identify and create shell variables, aliases and functions. And a brief look at how you can execute multiple contingent commands.</p>
<p>Whenever you find yourself at the command line of a Linux terminal, you’re inside what is commonly called a shell session. It’s important to be aware, however, that not all shell sessions are created equal, and that you can control the environment parameters of your shell through various configuration files. These files will determine things like which flavor of shell, like bash or sh, will be used, what color scheme if any will be displayed, and what information will be included in the command prompt.</p>
<h3 id="Linux-shell-session-types"><a href="#Linux-shell-session-types" class="headerlink" title="Linux shell session types"></a>Linux shell session types</h3><p>First of all, we’ll divide shell session types into two broad categories, login, and non-login. When you SSH into a remote server or sit at a terminal attached to a non-gui computer, you’ll be required to provide some kind of authentication information before you’re given access. These sessions are called login shells. When, on the other hand, you open a terminal window from inside a GUI desktop session, you won’t normally need to authenticate. So it’s considered a non-login shell.</p>
<p>Why should we care? Because the configuration files used to control shell properties for login sessions are not the same as those read by non-login sessions. A login shell will first read and apply the contents of &#x2F;etc&#x2F;profile, and then look in the user’s home directory for each of bash_profile, bash_login, and .profile in that order. The parameters included in the first of these files that’s found will be applied. The environments for non-login shell sessions are set based on both the system-wide values in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;bash.bashrc file and the .bashrc file in the user’s home directory. You can edit the settings in any of these files, but you should also know that doing it wrong can sometimes lead to rather unexpected results.</p>
<p>The dot at the beginning of these files tells the system that they’re hidden. Had I used ls without the -a to list the directory contents, these wouldn’t have shown up. There is actually an unconnected use of the dot, that all the same happens to be very closely related to our discussion. If you want to change profiles in the middle of a shell session, you can type say . space .bashrc, which will activate the parameters of the .bashrc file. You can similarly use source.bashrc to accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the .bashlogout file controls how shell sessions end. Typically, the file will instruct Linux to clear the shell screen on exit out of security considerations. While this isn’t directly related to shell sessions as such, the LPIC exam expects that you’ll also be familiar with the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;skel directory. Files and directories that you place in skel, which is short for skeleton, will be copied to the home directories of all new user accounts that you create. This could be a great place to create a single company guide, or policy document that will automatically show up in all new accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s review. Shell environments are controlled by profile configuration files. For login sessions, Linux will read &#x2F;etc&#x2F;profile, and then the first of bash_profile, bashlogin, and profile. For non-login sessions, &#x2F;etc&#x2F;bash-bashrc comes first, and then bashrc. Source, or the dot can be used to tell Linux to switch to a different profile. And bash_logout controls shell behavior at exit.</p>
<h3 id="Understanding-Linux-shell-variables"><a href="#Understanding-Linux-shell-variables" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Linux shell variables"></a>Understanding Linux shell variables</h3><p>The truth is that we’ve already touched on shell variables in this series once in the introduction, and again in the Working on the Command Line video from the fourth course. So we’ll rather briefly cover this topic, focusing mainly on a couple of details we haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>You can create a variable that’s unique to your current shell using something like user&#x3D;myname. Echo $user will print the value of user to the screen. Export will pass a variable to all child shells within the current one. Set without any command line arguments will print all current shell variables and functions. Env, again without arguments, will list only variables. Unset will remove a particular value.</p>
<p>Now we’ll move on to material that we haven’t yet covered. Alias can create a local customized command, complete with it’s own arguments. Alias on it’s own will list all current aliases. Note the alias, alert. It’s a little script that will send an alert notification to your desktop upon completion of a task. All you need to do to run alert, is to add it to the end of your command after a semicolon, and it will execute when the command itself returns a success code.</p>
<p>Let’s try creating our own alias. Suppose, from time to time, I need to remind myself of which time zone my computer is set to. I’ll run alias followed by the name of the alias I’d like to create, print tz in my case. Then within quotation marks, I’ll simply type the commands I’d like to run, separated by semicolons. Once that’s done, I can type my alias name and the operation will execute. Removing an alias works using unalias.</p>
<p>You can also create mini programs that you can run from the command line using function. Here’s an example that will accept user input through the $1 input variable, and then, using ls -l, list the files and directories that match the input. You can remove a function using unset -f and the function name.</p>
<p>To briefly review, you can create a system variable using name&#x3D;value. Export variable name will make the variable globally accessible. Unset variable name will delete the variable. You can create an alias that will run a series of commands, and unalias will remove the alias, as will exiting the shell. You can create a mini command line launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/linux-scripts-basics-1/">script</a> using function, and unset-f will remove the function.</p>
<h3 id="Scripting-contingent-commands-using-lists"><a href="#Scripting-contingent-commands-using-lists" class="headerlink" title="Scripting contingent commands using lists"></a>Scripting contingent commands using lists</h3><p>You can execute more than one command in a sequence using what are called lists. Now there’s no command called list so don’t look for details using man list. If you do want to read up on lists, enter the bash man file, and search using the forward slash for lists. In any case, using lists allows you to link the executions together. So for instance, you can make a command contingent on the successful completion of a previous command.<br>Let’s use ls to list all the files in this directory, but grep for only those files that contain stuff in their file names. There’s obviously only one of those. Then by adding two ampersand symbols, we’ll cat the contents of the file only if the ls operation was successful. However, suppose I change the grep string to stug. Since there is no stug file, the ls operation will fail, and the shell won’t get to the cat command.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, I would use a semicolon rather than two ampersands, I’ll be telling the shell to execute the second command regardless of whether the first command was successful or not. Thus, the file stuff is printed to the screen. That’s because semicolon just acts to tell the shell that these are two separate commands. You can get a similar effect, but for a different reason, using two pipe symbols. This one works because two pipes has the effect of or. Using or, however, will mean that only one of the two commands can execute. Therefore, if we change the commands so that the ls operation does execute, then the file will be listed through ls, but not displayed through cat.</p>
<p>Let’s review what we’ve learned about lists. Two ampersands will execute the command to the right only if the first command succeeds. Two pipes will execute the command to the right only if the first command fails. And a semicolon will execute both commands in all cases.</p>
<h1 id="Linux-scripts-the-basics"><a href="#Linux-scripts-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Linux scripts: the basics"></a>Linux scripts: the basics</h1><p>In this video and the next, we’re going to learn about Linux scripting. Scripting lies somewhere in between system administration and programming on the one hand, like programming, Bash scripts allow for loops, control structures and dynamic data handling. But on the other hand the syntax and execution is very closely integrated with the command line. In fact, any command that’s possible to run directly on the command line can be used as part of a script. Because scripts share the qualities of both of these worlds, they’re perfectly suited for their core task of automating administration tasks.</p>
<h3 id="Introduction-to-Linux-scripting"><a href="#Introduction-to-Linux-scripting" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to Linux scripting"></a>Introduction to Linux scripting</h3><p>Let’s begin at the beginning. A script is a plain text file that will often use a .sh extension. The first line of the script, known for some reason as the shebang line, identifies the interpreter you plan to use. In our case, we’ll type #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash which tells Linux that we want this script to use the rules of the Bash shell. Besides that first line, any line that begins with a hash is ignored by Bash and serves only as a comment. It is a very, very good practice to clearly comment every step of your scripts so that anyone reading it later will have some clue of what it’s supposed to do. This will not only help the poor fellow who comes after you but could serve you extremely well if you’re troubleshooting your own script months after you wrote it trying to figure out what stopped working and why. So I’ll take my own advice and add a comment to this first script.</p>
<p>For this simple example, we’ll echo a message exactly the way we’ve seen it done on the command line. On the next line of our script, I’ll type date which is a Linux command that prints the system date to the screen. “Exit 0” will end the script execution. Now we’ll save the script file and exit nano so we can actually run the script.</p>
<p>To run a script you type a dot and a forward slash and the name of the file. Whoops something went wrong. I can’t tell you many times I made this mistake and just sat staring stupidly at the screen and wondering what I could possibly have done to Linux to make it hate me so much. But here’s the problem. Remember back in the previous video when we discussed file permissions? We learned that there are three categories of permission: read, write and execute. Well it seems that you can’t execute a script unless the script file is executable. This one obviously isn’t. Let’s change that now using “chmod +x”and the name of the file.” Now let’s try that one again.</p>
<p>Let’s review. You begin each script with the shebang line. All other lines that start with a hash are ignored and used for comments. You need to make a file executable before it can be run as a script and running a script requires that the file name is prefaced by a dot and slash. \</p>
<h3 id="Using-user-inputs-and-arithmetic-in-Linux-scripts"><a href="#Using-user-inputs-and-arithmetic-in-Linux-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Using user inputs and arithmetic in Linux scripts"></a>Using user inputs and arithmetic in Linux scripts</h3><p>We are now going to explore quite a few examples designed to illustrate various key scripting syntax and command tools. I would advise you to pause the video now and then so you can think through each example for yourself. Make sure you understand what each line does and indeed what each character does. Ideally, you’ll open up your own terminal and play around with each of these tools for yourself. I would also advise you to type in the text of the scripts yourself so you get used to the syntax and get a feel for the kinds of mistakes that are commonly made.</p>
<p>Okay we’re ready to try something a bit more interactive. This script will ask the user to input some text then using the “read” command it will assign whatever the user types to a variable called answer. The script will print the answer and the words, “Okay it’s,” and then print the system date. Let’s exit and run it. Let’s see if we can work with numbers. If you have experience programming, you’ll probably have noted that we didn’t declare our variable in the last example. However, that’s only for simple text strings. If you want Bash to understand your input as an integer, you will have to declare it.</p>
<p>This example first declares three variables as integers. It will then ask the user for two numbers and use read to assign them to the number one and number two variables. Using simple arithmetic symbols like the equal sign or a plus sign you can create an equation that will give the sum of our two input variables to the variable total and print it out. Let’s run it.</p>
<p>It’s review time again. The read command will accept user input and assign it to a variable. You need to declare variables as integers if you want your script to work with them as numbers. And you can use the normal arithmetic symbols to perform math functions in a very simple way. We’ll continue with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/linux-scripts-control-structures-1/">scripts</a> in the next video.</p>
<h1 id="Linux-scripts-control-structures"><a href="#Linux-scripts-control-structures" class="headerlink" title="Linux scripts: control structures"></a>Linux scripts: control structures</h1><p>In this video, we’ll continue our study of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/linux-scripts-basics-1/">scripts</a>. Let’s learn how to test for an environment condition and only then execute a command. This script will ask the user for a directory you’d like to add to the system path, read the value into NewPath, then use -e, which I believe stands for “exists,” to test for the existence of the directory the user has entered. If the directory does exist, it will use PATH&#x3D;$PATH:$NewPath to add NewPath to the PATH, then export it. And finally, echo the new complete path variable. If, on the other hand, the directory does not exist, then this script will output a suitable message. Note, by the way, how calling an existing variable requires that it be prefaced by a dollar sign for Linux to understand that it’s a variable name we’re referring to, and not a text string or command. Let’s run the program and enter a valid directory. Now we’ll run it, but this time we’ll enter a non-valid directory.</p>
<p>Let’s try out an if-else statement. This script will use test to test for the existence of a file called stuff. If it does exist, in other words, if the test result is positive, then the “stuff exists” message will be printed. In every other case, meaning if else is satisfied, “stuff does not exist” will be printed. Note how you need to close the if-else filter with the letters fi, which is if backwards. We’ll run the script.</p>
<h3 id="Testing-for-environment-conditions-using-“test”-in-Linux-scripts"><a href="#Testing-for-environment-conditions-using-“test”-in-Linux-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Testing for environment conditions using “test” in Linux scripts"></a>Testing for environment conditions using “test” in Linux scripts</h3><p>We should look more deeply into test. As you saw, we added the -f argument, which tells test to confirm that the file not only exists, but that it’s a regular file. -d will make test confirm that the target is a directory, and -r will confirm that it’s a file, and that it’s readable. Test can also be used to compare two values. Here we’ve given the value of hello to the text1 variable and goodbye to the text2 variable. I would imagine that both of us could tell pretty quickly whether the two are equal. Hint: they’re not. Let’s see if Linux can figure it out. Using an if-else statement, we’ll ask test to confirm whether text1 and text2 are not identical. The exclamation mark and equals sign mean not equal. We’ll run the script to show that indeed, just as we suspected, hello and goodbye are not identical. We could also use an equal sign on its own to confirm that two values are identical.</p>
<p>Tests run with the -eq argument will confirm whether two integers are equal to each other. -lt tells us that one integer is less than the other, and -gt tells us that one integer is greater than the other.</p>
<p>Let’s review. -e, which is an alternative to test, tests if a resource exists. If-else statements provide simple yes&#x2F;no deicsion-making. Test -f will test for the existence of a file, -d for a directory, and -r for readable. Test with the equal sign between two strings will test to see if they are the same. Exclamation mark and equal sign will test if they are not the same. You can compare integers with a test -eq, confirming that they’re equal, -lt, that the first value is less than the second value, and -gt, that the first value is greater than the second value.</p>
<h3 id="Using-conditional-statements-if-else-in-Linux-scripts"><a href="#Using-conditional-statements-if-else-in-Linux-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Using conditional statements (if-else) in Linux scripts"></a>Using conditional statements (if-else) in Linux scripts</h3><p>If-else statements work well when there are only two possible options: either something is true or it’s not. If your choices are more complicated and you need to allow for multiple possible answers, you’re better off choosing case. Here’s how it could work. This script will take a user input and assign it to the variable color. The words case $COLOR in could be understood as “in the case where color equals one of these possibilities.” Meaning either red or blue, the script will echo, “Nice! I love that color.” As you can see, a user input of orange or brown will generate a “Not bad . . . “ response, and black or purple will get the “Yuk!” message. All other input, covered by the asterisk, will produce the “Sorry, I’m not familiar” error message. Note the rather odd syntax needed to make a case structure work, like the double colons and closing parentheses, or the pipe symbol in place of or. And note also how we close a case structure with the word esac, which is case backwards.</p>
<p>Let’s try running the script and inputting blue, then brown and finally green, which wasn’t one of our listed examples.</p>
<h3 id="Working-with-loops-in-Linux-scripts"><a href="#Working-with-loops-in-Linux-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Working with loops in Linux scripts"></a>Working with loops in Linux scripts</h3><p>A while loop will continue executing a command as long as, or in other words, while a specified condition is met. In this case, we’ve given the variable COUNTER the numeric value of 10. And using COUNTER&#x3D;COUNTER-1, we’re going to reduce that value by one each time through the loop. As long as the value of COUNTER is still greater than two, we’ll print the value at the end of the “The counter is” sentence. Once the value of COUNTER drops below three, the done line tells the script to stop. Let’s try it.</p>
<p>You can also execute commands through each cycle of a loop using until rather than while. Until will cause the commands to repeat until a certain condition is met, rather than while a condition is still true. In this case, we’ve set counter to 20 to start off. And again, we’ll reduce that by one each cycle through the loop. Now, however, we’ll continue the loop only until COUNTER is less than 10. Let’s see how that works.</p>
<p>For can execute a command against each item in a list. In this example, we’ll use the list of files and directories generated by ls as input, assign it to the variable i, replacing any previous value it might have had, and echo the value to the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, you can, for example, feed the for loop with the output of seq. Let’s just run seq directly from the command line to get a feel for how it works. Seq 15 will count up one number at a time, in sequence, hence the name seq, until it gets to 15. Seq 5 15 will count up between five and 15. Seq 3 6 21 will count between three and 21, but by increments of six. Now let’s see how that might work within a script. Here we’ll feed our variable i with the simple seq 15 command, which will count up by ones between one and 15. For each loop cycle, the script will output the current value of i and the message. Let’s run it.</p>
<p>These last few examples may have seemed rather simple, and in fact a bit redundant. However, each of them was included to illustrate a distinct and unique tool which can be used to produce very different results.</p>
<p>Now let’s review this material. Case can handle multiple possible conditions, while loops continue executing a command as long as a set condition is still true. Until loops will execute only until a condition is met. For loops will execute a command against items on a list. And you can seed for loops with the output of the seq command, which counts in sequence.</p>
<h1 id="Databases-MySQL"><a href="#Databases-MySQL" class="headerlink" title="Databases: MySQL"></a>Databases: MySQL</h1><p>In truth managing databases is a skill all its own that isn’t directly connected to operating system administration. But because so many of the deployments you’ll administrate involve or even depend on databases you really have no choice but to pick up at least a simple understanding of how they work.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking there are two kinds of databases. Heavily structured relational databases, which can be managed by structured query language, SQL environments, and nonrelational, noSQL databases whose popularity’s been growing due to a simpler design that emphasizes speed over consistency. While both database types are important, the LPIC exam expects you to focus on relational databases and specifically the MySQL relational database management system.</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt to be aware that the original developers of MySQL actually left the project a few years ago to create MariaDB. At this point, MariaDB is completely compatible with MySQL and can be used and accessed in exactly the same ways. It has even begun to replace MySQL in some major <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/course-introduction-25/">Linux</a> software stacks. So while my references will be to MySQL they’re all equally relevant to MariaDB.</p>
<p>A relational database is made up of tables, records and fields. Let’s imagine a database with two tables used by a company to track incoming communications. The first table contains information about customer complaints and the second customer compliments. Since the compliments table is likely to be mostly empty, we’ll focus on the complaints. Each record represents a single email complaint. The record contains fields for the date and timestamp, the senders email address, the message itself and any response sent by the company.</p>
<h3 id="Working-with-MySQL-relational-databases-in-Linux"><a href="#Working-with-MySQL-relational-databases-in-Linux" class="headerlink" title="Working with MySQL relational databases in Linux"></a>Working with MySQL relational databases in Linux</h3><p>Let’s spend some time working on an actual MySQL database. First, we’ll install MySQL on the Ubuntu virtual machine. When prompted during the setup process, I’ll create a password for the root account. Once everything’s in place, you can enter the MySQL environment using “mysql -u username -p.” I’ll use root for username. “-p” will prompt you for the root password.</p>
<p>We’re now in MySQL land where every command has to end with a semicolon. If you forget to add a semicolon - and you definitely will at some point - the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/working-with-linux-shells-1/">shell</a> will simply dump you onto a new line and patiently wait for the rest of the command until you wake up and remember what it’s expecting. “Show databases” by the way will display all the databases currently part of this installation.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new database called “Communications” and run “show databases” once again. Our new communications database is there. Since we’ll want to work with communications, we’ll have to let MySQL in on our plans. Otherwise, it won’t know that it’s supposed to apply the coming commands to this particular database. We’ll do that with use. We’ll run show tables to confirm that communications doesn’t yet have any tables. So we’ll create a new table. We’ll use create table, give it the name complaints and map out the fields each record will have. The date field will use the date format. The email field, will use the varchar format and allow as many as 20 characters. The message and response fields will allow up to 250 characters.</p>
<p>When we hit enter, MySQL will parse the command to make sure the syntax is correct. If there’s anything wrong, you’ll get an error message. Now let’s enter some data using insert into the complaints table by first defining the specific values we’d like to populate. You don’t need to add data for every column but you do need to tell MySQL which columns you’re adding. We’ll then add these values. As I enter the date, email, message and response values note how fields are created by commas but no spaces. Users won’t usually enter data this way. It’s far more common for database managers or developers to create a front-end application that makes data entry intuitive but under the bright and shiny surface of that front end this is exactly the structure that will be used. We’ll have to make sure that our insert operation worked so we’ll run select everything from complaints where the asterisks represents everything.</p>
<p>Let’s enter one more record but this time we’ll insert data into only three fields, rather than all four. We’ll run select again to make sure this one worked. Although if there was anything wrong, the MySQL command line would almost certainly have complained loudly about it already. I’ve added some more records to our table to make it easier to illustrate the next operations. Let’s take another look at the table to see how it looks now.</p>
<p>Let’s review. You list the databases in your MySQL environment using show databases. Create databases. Database name will create a new, empty database. You tell MySQL that you want to work with a specific database using “use” database name. You create a new table within a database with the create table command and by specifying the columns, their character types and maximum length. You can add data to a table using “insert into” specifying to which columns you’re going to add data. And then the data for each field enclosed by apostrophes. You can display data from a table using “select.”</p>
<h3 id="Accessing-and-manipulating-MySQL-data-using-select"><a href="#Accessing-and-manipulating-MySQL-data-using-select" class="headerlink" title="Accessing and manipulating MySQL data using select"></a>Accessing and manipulating MySQL data using select</h3><p>You can also select records based on precise filters. So for instance, you could specify all records associated with a particular customer by selecting all records whose email field equals that customer’s email address. If you need to delete records, suppose Joe at cranky.com finally realized that he wasn’t getting anywhere with his constant complaints and decided to take his business elsewhere, you could run the select operation we just did to confirm it’s picking up exactly the records we need and then run it again using delete instead of select to remove all records whose email field is <a href="mailto:&#74;&#x6f;&#101;&#x40;&#x63;&#114;&#97;&#110;&#x6b;&#121;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#74;&#x6f;&#101;&#x40;&#x63;&#114;&#97;&#110;&#x6b;&#121;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.</p>
<p>We can use update and set to edit the contents of individual or groups of fields. Here we’ll change Joe’s email and message fields to update them to new values. By the way, if you don’t specify where these values should change, MySQL will assume you want to give these new values to every email and message field in the whole table. You can also choose a column to display our records according to a specified order using either “order by” or “group by.” This will arrange all of our records in ascending order by date. You could now, if necessary, submit just these records to some operation. Adding desc, on the other hand will arrange our records by date in descending order.</p>
<p>To illustrate group by I’ll create a new table that contains customer orders including the item purchased and the price paid. Note how the customer and price columns use integer as their format type so we can use their contents as numeric values. I’ll insert some data so we can work with it. Let’s take a look at our table. We can see that books seems to be our most popular item. We’ve already sold three of them. If you wanted MySQL to report the total revenue per item type, you could select all the items and using the contents of the price and item columns calculate the sum of the prices. The three books we sold generated a total of $30 in revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, we should at least briefly describe how to use data from two separate tables. If we look once again at our purchases table, we see that every customer has an ID number. I’ll create another table called customers in which I’ll place some customer information. For simplicity sake, I’ll use only their first names. Again, I’ll create some data. Let’s take another look at both our purchases and customers tables. Now suppose you wanted to use our data from purchases but incorporate customer names into the output. We’ll use a simple join operation that looks like this. We’ll select from purchases and from customers separated by a comma all records where the customer field from the purchases table equals the ID field from the customers table. This will display each purchase with the correct customer ID data appended to the right.</p>
<p>It’s review time. You can select only records corresponding to specified filters using select with “where.” “Delete” follows the same syntax as select but will actually delete the return data. You can edit a record using “update set” and “where.” You can control the order data is displayed and used with “order by” and tally totals with “select item” and “group by.” We can intelligently join data from two tables by using select and where to reference the specific tables and columns you need to use.</p>
<h1 id="Databases-the-AWS-way"><a href="#Databases-the-AWS-way" class="headerlink" title="Databases: the AWS way"></a>Databases: the AWS way</h1><h3 id="Migrating-a-MySQL-database-to-the-AWS-Relational-Database-Service-RDS"><a href="#Migrating-a-MySQL-database-to-the-AWS-Relational-Database-Service-RDS" class="headerlink" title="Migrating a MySQL database to the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)"></a>Migrating a MySQL database to the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)</h3><p>In this video, we’re going to spend some time exploring <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/databases-mysql-1/">MySQL</a> the AWS way. We’re going to learn how to launch and then login to an Amazon RDS hosted MySQL instance and then lift and drop a locally created database into it.</p>
<p>Hosting your database operations on AWS’s relational database service has some enormous advantages. The hardware is fully managed by AWS so you don’t have to worry about server failure, software updates, data replication, and backup and to a large degree even security. Once you’ve set things up, there’s really nothing for you to do besides focus on your data.</p>
<p>Part of the stability of AWS databases is the way they structure their hardware infrastructure for you. If you choose to create a multi-AZ deployment, your data is spread across more than one geographic availability zone to ensure that even if something should cause one to crash the others will survive and continue to provide full service.</p>
<p>To make this work we’ll make use of a DB subnet group that we’ll specify during configuration. Let’s create our DB instance. From the RDS menu, check to make sure we’re in the right AWS region then click on “Launch DB Instance.” We’ll select “MySQL.” We’ll say, “Yes,” to be given the option of multi-AZ deployment and provisioned IOP storage and click “Next Step.” We’ll choose the most recent MySQL release version, select a db.t2.micro as our instance, say “Yes” to multi-AZ and leave the storage options as default. We can change any of these hardware configurations later - something that would be unspeakably complicated in a local data center. We’ll use “New DB” as DB identifier, “Admin” as a master username, and a password that’s at least eight characters long.</p>
<p>Now we’ll place our new DB inside our default VPC, select the “MySQL group,” subnet group that we have available in our particular VPC and leave the instance privacy setting as not publicly available. For our security group, which will control all traffic into and out of our RDS instance, we’ll select an existing group and come back to it a bit later to make sure that it’s set up the way we want. We won’t create a database right now and we’ll leave the rest of the settings as they are. Note that MySQL will use port 3306 for communications.</p>
<p>Now we’ll click on “Launch DB Instance” and head back to the RDS dashboard to see what’s happening. Since AWS is still creating our instance, it doesn’t yet display an endpoint. While we’re waiting, we’ll click on the “Configuration Details” tab and click on “Our Security Group.” We’ll click on the “Inbound” tab and then on the “Edit” button. Here we’ll add a new rule that will allow MySQL traffic into the instance from my IP address. Note how AWS automatically filled in the 3306 port. You should remove all other rules, because in our case at least, there’s no other traffic that should be allowed in. We’ll save the rule.</p>
<p>Once our DB instance is up and running, we’re shown the endpoint. It’s important to ignore the :3306 at the end. As for what we’re doing, it’ll just get in the way. Now let’s start a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/lpic1-linux-shells-scripting-and-databases/working-with-linux-shells-1/">shell</a> in our local machine and connect directly to our RDS instance. Let’s create a new database. That’s enough for now. We’ll exit the session.</p>
<p>Now back on our local machine we’ll create a full backup of the communications database we were working on for the last video using the mysqldump program and pipe it to the file communications.sql. It really amazes me just how simple this next step is. We’re going to upload the dump of our local database into the communications database on RDS using one simple command “-h” indicates that the next value is the endpoint address of the database host, “-u” is followed by the master username we chose, “-p” will prompt for a password. Communications specifies the remote database we want to work with and the arrow character will apply the .sql file to the working database. That’s it.</p>
<p>Now to make sure that everything actually worked we’ll log in to our RDS instance again just as we did the first time. We’ll load the communications database that we created before. And we’ll use “show” to display the database tables which are those we’ve created for our local deployment.</p>
