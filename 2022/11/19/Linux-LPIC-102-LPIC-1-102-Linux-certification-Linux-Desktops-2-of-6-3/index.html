<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Even though the vast majority of videos in this series are devoted to working with the Linux server, in fact, the certification we’re working towards is called Server Professional. A Linux admin must also know how to build and manage graphic-based interfaces so users will be able to get much of their daily work done.</p>
<p>This rather brief course will focus on the display managers and graphic desktop environments that make all that possible.</p>
<p>We’ll explore how to make sure that the hardware peripherals you’d like to work with are actually compatible with Linux, and if they are, how to get even non-mainstream hardware configurations working properly with your system. We’ll also demonstrate the use of some particularly useful diagnostic tools for displaying hardware profile information and for controlling remote graphic login sessions. We’ll learn about display managers, what they do, and how we can get them do it, and then particularly LightDM display manager, which the latest LPIC exam released considers the most important in its class. In the System Accessibility lecture, we’ll learn about the Linux screen, keyboard, and mouse adaptation utilities meant to improve the computing experiences for users with partially or fully impaired vision, hearing, or movement. Finally, we’ll have some fun building a graphic user interface on top of a virtual server running on an Amazon Web Services EC2 Instance.</p>
<h1 id="Install-and-configure-desktops"><a href="#Install-and-configure-desktops" class="headerlink" title="Install and configure desktops"></a>Install and configure desktops</h1><p>As you are probably already aware, these days the XWindows system on most Linux distros will automatically recognize the hardware peripherals, like monitors and mice, that are connected to the system. But this won’t always be the case, especially if you ever have to work with minimal or older hardware running some of the less consumer-oriented software packages.</p>
<p>Therefore, a Linux sysadmin needs to know how to work with all of the available configuration tools. But before we get to that point, it’s important to know how to find out whether a particular hardware device is actually compatible with the Linux kernel. Checking in advance can obviously save you both unnecessary expense and trouble. Depending on the class of peripheral you’re looking at, there’s actually quite a range of excellent community and vendor based resources. Video cards are often very complicated devices to get working on non-mainstream systems, and there’s plenty of help available online.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring-Linux-desktops-using-xwindows"><a href="#Configuring-Linux-desktops-using-xwindows" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Linux desktops using xwindows"></a>Configuring Linux desktops using xwindows</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/projects/drivers">http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/projects/drivers</a> contains links to information on most major and some minor chip sets. As it turns out, in many cases, you won’t even need to go that far. The man help system has more useful information on this than you might think. Running Man ATI for instance, will give you a compatibility overview of all ATI graphing drivers. Man trident will do the same for trident drivers.</p>
<p>Once you’re confident that your device should work, you’ll have to actually get it going. If Linux doesn’t pick up the device on its own, you might need to work with configuration files. For XWindows, you’ll need to edit either xorg.conf or xf86Config. Both of these files will usually live in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;X11 directory. Note the X of X11 is upper case. But here, things get a bit weird. If you’re running Ubuntu or Fedora, or another modern consumer friendly distribution, then neither of those two files will likely exist. The standard setup simply doesn’t use them anymore and hasn’t for years. But that doesn’t mean you can’t create your own. And as I mentioned just before, if you’re trying to get a non-standard hardware combination going, or you’d like to change the mode used by a video driver, you may very well need to create one.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample XOrg.com file. You can see that the file is divided into sections, like server layout and files. Most sections contain information identifying a device and setting the mode and configuration in which it’ll run. Thus, the first input device section identifies a mouse, its driver, and a number of options. The second input device section does the same for a keyboard. The monitor section identifies your monitor and the device section, your video driver.</p>
<p>This next section, called Screen is interesting. It binds together the video driver from device, and the monitor from the monitor section. The most important section of them all is server layout, which in this example, is all the way at the top. Server layout glues all the sections together into a single working hardware profile.</p>
<p>Linux comes with some very useful configuration diagnostic tools. XWinInfo will display information about a particular window. Let’s run XWinInfo from this terminal and then click on the terminal itself. Of course, we could also have clicked on any other window that happens to be open on our desktop. We’re given the window’s current screen coordinates, size, color depth, and other details. If you’re on a system that has access to multiple monitors, you might want to confirm how a particular one of them is designated. This you can do through the display variable. Running echo display, taking care to type display in upper case characters, tells us what we want to know.</p>
<p>XDPYinfo, which I believe stands for X Windows display information, will return the current system display configuration, along with all the alternate display and modes that are possible using your hardware profile. As you can see, the problem with XDPY info is that there’s really too much information to absorb so quickly. Let’s slow that down a bit by piping it to less, which will let us view it one screen at a time. Now we can see information about display size, a list of available extensions, and then details about the screen’s capabilities. I have to admit that I don’t understand too much about this, but one day you might really appreciate it.</p>
<h3 id="Controlling-access-to-Linux-desktop-sessions"><a href="#Controlling-access-to-Linux-desktop-sessions" class="headerlink" title="Controlling access to Linux desktop sessions"></a>Controlling access to Linux desktop sessions</h3><p>Since it’s possible for remote users to log into your machine and start a graphic session, for security reasons, it’s very important to know how to control who and if anyone will be allowed. Naturally, your private IP address should never be exposed to anyone outside your local network, and if your routing rules are properly set up, that should never happen. But you might also want to control which local network users are granted access.</p>
<p>You do this with xhost. xhost followed by the plus sign, will enable graphic access to anyone. xhost and the minus sign will restrict access to anyone who hasn’t explicitly been allowed. You can permit access from computers using a particular IP address using xhost + followed by the IP address. And xhost with the minus sign and an IP address, will remove access from an IP address that had been previously allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, the LPIC expects you to be familiar with the X font server. Now I have to tell you that the people responsible for maintaining the LPIC exam, who do a terrific job by the way, already three years ago, seem pretty much an agreement that the X font server should be removed from the list of exam expectations. They know that there’s no way anyone will ever again have to actually use it, nor has it been used for many years. I’m not exactly sure why then, after all these years have passed, X font server is still there. But in any case, consider yourselves familiar with it.</p>
<p>Let’s review. You can use the man system to view configuration details for a graphic hardship sets, the files, XOrg.com and XF86config found in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;x11 directory are used to configure system peripherals. The screen section of the XOrg.com file binds together data from the monitor and device sections, and the server layout section glues all sections together to create a total system profile. XWin Info displays information about a particular window. The display variable contains your display designation. XDPY info returns information about your current display. xhost + will allow access to any remote graphic logins, xhost - will restrict access to all but explicitly approved logins. xhost + and an IP address will add the address to the allowed list. And xhost - and an address will remove that address from the allowed list. Finally, X Font server doesn’t do anything at all.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-Display-Managers"><a href="#Working-with-Display-Managers" class="headerlink" title="Working with Display Managers"></a>Working with Display Managers</h1><h3 id="Working-with-Linux-display-managers-including-LightDM"><a href="#Working-with-Linux-display-managers-including-LightDM" class="headerlink" title="Working with Linux display managers including LightDM"></a>Working with Linux display managers including LightDM</h3><p>The role of Linux display managers has historically been something of a moving target, while managers like XDM, KDM, and GDM have and in some cases, still do enjoy widespread adoption, as of the most recent update to their exam topics, the LPIC wants us to focus most of our attention on LightDM. Nevertheless, we should spend just a few moments discussing those three older display managers. XDM, the X window<br>display manager has been around since 1988. That’s 1988, long before Linux was born. It’s a very minimal environment that’s really only useful for supporting standalone X terminal-like systems.</p>
<p>The Gnome display manager, GDM was designed as a graphical replacement for XDM, and allows users to manage their environment settings for both attached and remote displays through GUI rather than command line tools. KDM is the display manager of the KDE desktop environment. KDE, by the way, has been competing for some years against Gnome and among others, Ubuntu’s Unity, for the hearts and minds of free desktop<br>environment users.</p>
<p>Because it’s designed to work without the need to load much overhead at all, LightDM is quite a bit faster than some of the older alternatives. It also does quite a bit less than traditional display managers, which would provide window control elements, manage virtual desktops and provide windows frames functionality. LightDM, on the other hand, is normally only there to start X servers, user sessions, and the greeter login screen.</p>
<p>Let’s see how system administrators can manage LightDM configurations. While LightDM will read configuration details from files in the &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf.d directory, you can only edit those values<br>from either files in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf.d directory, or from the lightdm.com file in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;lightdm directory. In my case, there are no files in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf.d directory, and<br>lightdm.conf, as you can see, states that my current default desktop session will use Gnome Fallback. If I wanted to change that value, I would either edit this file or create a file with the same contents in the lightdm.conf.d directory, named something like 50-myconfig.conf.</p>
<p>You can see a sample configuration file with all the available options in your &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;doc&#x2F;lightdm directory. Since the file is compressed, we’ll use gunzip to make it readable. And since we’re in the &#x2F;user directory tree, we’ll need to become sudo to save the decompressed file.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring-the-lightDM-display-manager"><a href="#Configuring-the-lightDM-display-manager" class="headerlink" title="Configuring the lightDM display manager"></a>Configuring the lightDM display manager</h3><p>There are a number of configurations you can control from the LightDM.conf file. By default, users can log into a lightDM system without a password, as guest. If you would like to disable this, add a line<br>reading allow-guest&#x3D;false to the lightdm.conf file. Normally, the greeter screen displays a menu list of system users. If you’d like to disable this, which would require users to type their user names in manually, add greeter-hide-users&#x3D;true. You can set the system to automatically log in a particular user by adding the auto login-user line to the lightdm.conf file, followed by the particular user name. If<br>you’d like to set a grace period within which users can override the auto login default, add the time outline, where you can specify the length of the delay period in seconds. If you’re building some kind<br>of public access kiosk, you might like to set the auto login to a guest session. You can do this with auto login-guest&#x3D;true, and obviously without the timeout option. To change the greeter itself, you can<br>reference a greeter.desktop file in your &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;xgreeters directory from the lightdm.conf file, using something like this. Finally, if you want LightDM to run a script on start up, you can add a reference to this command as part of a session-setup-scriptline. LightDM has more options that you can see in the sample.com file we viewed earlier, in &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;doc&#x2F;lightdm.</p>
<p>Let’s review what we now know about the LightDM display manager. LightDM reads files in the &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf.d directory, but the config values are edited, using &#x2F;etc&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf, or individual files in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;lightdm&#x2F;lightdm.conf.d. By adding entries to the lightdm.conf file, you can control the display manager’s login behavior. Adding allow-guest&#x3D;false will prevent guest user logins. Greeter-hide-users&#x3D;false will prevent a user menu from being displayed. Autologin user&#x3D;username will automatically log the specified user into the system on boot. And autologin guest&#x3D;true will create a public access kiosk. You can change the greeter itself by pointing to the appropriate file in &#x2F;user&#x2F;share&#x2F;xgreeters. And finally, you can have light DM run scripts or commands for you at start up.</p>
<h1 id="Manage-system-access-settings"><a href="#Manage-system-access-settings" class="headerlink" title="Manage system access settings"></a>Manage system access settings</h1><h3 id="Managing-Linux-system-accessibility-for-people-with-disabilities"><a href="#Managing-Linux-system-accessibility-for-people-with-disabilities" class="headerlink" title="Managing Linux system accessibility (for people with disabilities)"></a>Managing Linux system accessibility (for people with disabilities)</h3><p>Linux developers have done terrific work opening up the operating system to users with disabilities. There are now utilities to assist individuals with limited vision, hearing, or movement. In this video, we’ll explore how to work with the accessibility features available for Linux.</p>
<p>I will note that each Linux desktop, whether it’s Unity, KDE, or some flavor of Gnome will place menu links to their accessibility control interfaces in different places. In fact, individual desktops will often undergo significant changes to their menu structure between one release and the next, which can sometimes be rather annoying. But for our purposes, it’s not really so important exactly which menu sequence you use to get to them, as long as you are aware of these features and know how to apply them.</p>
<h3 id="Linux-visual-and-audio-access-tools"><a href="#Linux-visual-and-audio-access-tools" class="headerlink" title="Linux visual and audio access tools"></a>Linux visual and audio access tools</h3><p>As it happens, I’m working with Ubuntu 14.04’s Gnome fallback desktop. Accessibility tools are meant to help users access their screen, audio, keyboard, and mouse. We’ll start with screen utilities. When you toggle the Orca Screenreader on, a voice will automatically audibly read whichever screen element currently has focus. It will therefore, read out each of the menu items that I click on or hover over as I work through options within a new menu I’ve opened. Using the keys on the number pad of your keyboard, you can also make Orca read previous or subsequent lines of text in relation to your cursor or window title and menu bars.</p>
<p>Turning on high contrast will temporarily reset your desktop theme to be more readable. It may look a bit ugly to us, but it can make a computer usable for someone with impaired vision. Large text will increase the text scale factor by about 25%. There is currently a known bug in the large text module that’s affecting some Linux installations, including mine. Braille display will use the BRLTTY daemon to output text to USB connected, refreshable Braille display devices. Just in case you aren’t aware, Braille is a universally used writing system that allows blind people to read using their sense of touch.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the Linux screen magnifier has not always been installed by default over the past few years. As you can see from my universal access interface, there’s currently no link. While I can’t explain why that should be, you can easily fix it by installing a screen magnification software package, like KMag. Clicking on the mouse button on the type right will cause the KMag display to follow your mouse around your screen, displaying enlarged images.</p>
<p>For users with hearing impairments or perhaps individuals whose PCs lack speakers, missing audio alerts can be a concern. To add a visual cue to every audio alert, you can toggle visual alerts, and select between having just the window title flash or the whole screen.</p>
<h3 id="Linux-keyboard-and-mouse-access-tools"><a href="#Linux-keyboard-and-mouse-access-tools" class="headerlink" title="Linux keyboard and mouse access tools"></a>Linux keyboard and mouse access tools</h3><p>Using a keyboard and mouse can be particularly challenging for people with reduced motor control. Just imagine how hard it can be to execute certain multiple keystroke combinations if you can barely lift your arm, or even if your arm is temporarily in a cast. Sticky keys will interpret the pressing of a modifier key, like control or shift, followed by any other keystroke, as though they were pressed together. This can be helpful for people who find simultaneous keystroke combinations a problem. Slow keys, bounce keys, and repeat keys can add greater accuracy for individuals unable to completely control their finger movement.</p>
<p>Slow keys lengthens the time between the initial key stroke and the point where the key stroke will register. Bounce keys inserts a longer delay between key strokes, ignoring accidental key strokes caused by unwanted movements between one key and another. Repeat keys, accessed through the keyboard menu will allow more time for user to release a key at the end of a key stroke before considering it as a repeated command. You can lengthen or shorten the delay or disable repeat keys altogether.</p>
<p>The way the system reacts to your mouse can be controlled by a number of utilities. Enabling mouse keys will allow your keyboard arrow keys to take over the mouse cursor movements, providing easier control and movement accuracy. If double-clicking your mouse is difficult, you can set your mouse to accept a longer, single click in place of a double click through simulated secondary click. The acceptance delay setting lets you define how long you’ll need to hold the mouse button down before a second click is simulated. Hover click, which is also sometimes referred to as dwell click, tells the system to interpret a mouse cursor that hovers for a set time as a click. This can help people who find it difficult to accurately click the left mouse button. It can also help children with smaller hands.</p>
<p>Finally, for people who are unable to use a keyboard at all, an onscreen keyboard displays a virtual keyboard that can be used with mouse clicks. Clicking on the large X at the top right of the keyboard will disable the tool. It took me a few anxious moments to figure that one out for myself.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly review. People with reduced vision can use the audible screen reader, high contrast, a screen magnifying tool, and the USB Braille interface. Visual alerts provide visual cues in place of audio alerts. Users with movement issues can get help with their keyboards through sticky keys, slow keys, bounce keys, and repeat keys. Help with mouse control is available through mouse keys, simulated secondary click, hover click, and through an onscreen keyboard.</p>

We’ll do that in a place you’d never normally expect to see anything graphic, on an Amazon web services EC2 virtual machine. Naturally, the real value of cloud based virtual machines is in their ability to launch light and serve web applications. That generally means terminal command line interfaces. However, you never know when you might have a need for a GUI Linux desktop in the cloud, so let’s give it a try.</p>
<p>We’ll first go to the EC2 dashboard and click on launch instance. We’ll select a 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 Amazon machine image, and go with the T2 micro instance type. This type, by the way, will be too small and slow for most useful purposes, but it will serve as a nice illustration. We’ll accept the instance detail defaults and go onto storage, whose defaults we’ll also accept. Choosing a security group to control traffic into and out of our instance will be important. We’ll create a new security group, and for security purposes, first limit SSH access to my local IP address, which Amazon inserts automatically. Then, we’ll add a new custom TCP rule, which will allow traffic through port 5901, which happens to be the default port for VNC - VNC stands for virtual network computing - and limit its access to my local IP. We’ll review, confirm that my key pair is available, and launch the instance.</p>
<p>We’ll head back to the EC2 dashboard where, after a minute or two, our instance’s new public IP address will be displayed. Once we get that IP address, we can SSH into a terminal session, where we can set up our graphic desktop. I use -i to point to the newkey.pem key pair that’s in the current directory, and then ibuntu @ the IP address I was given. Since this is obviously the first time I’ve logged into this instance, I’ll have to acknowledge that the new authentication key will be added to my allowed list.</p>
<p>The first thing we will do in our brand new virtual server is create a new user who’ll be the owner of the VNC hosting session. He’ll need a password, too. Next, we’ll add our new user to the admin group, using user mod. Now we’ll use su to switch users to become our new user. There’s a simple change we’ll have to make to the sshd_config file to allow password based access to our system. We’ll scroll down to the password authentication line, and change its no value to yes. So that this change can take effect, we’ll restart SSH, using service restart.</p>
<p>We’re now ready to install the software that Ubuntu will need to host graphic sessions. In fact, Ubuntu desktop is a very convenient metapackage, that includes the dozens or even hundreds of packages that are necessary to get the graphic desktop running. Once that’s done, we’ll install the VNC4 server package to permit graphic hosting sessions. Now we’ll run VNC server, which will prompt us to create a VNC password. Remember the password because we’ll need it later.</p>
<p>Since we’re going to edit the VNC configuration, we’ll shut down VNC server using -kill. The VNC config files can be found in a hidden directory in my user’s home directory. ls -a will show all directory contents, including hidden. We’ll cd to the .vnc directory, and using Nano, open the X startup file for editing. Now here, we’re faced with a number of possibilities. For some people, it’s enough to simply uncomment these two lines and add sh after exec. But I found that for me, that configuration hasn’t been successful. So I’m going to replace the entire script with this text. Notice how the script calls Nautilus, the Linux file manager. This will start a session within Nautilus. If you would leave that line out, this session would open with a terminal window instead. That would be really nice and all but hardly useful, considering that we’re already in a terminal window.</p>
<p>We’ll exit and save the file and restart VNC server. We’ll now go back to our local computer and use Remmina, a very nice little remote desktop client to open a session on our AWS server. We’ll start a new connection using the VNC protocol. We’ll insert our EC2 instance’s public IP address, followed by a colon and the number one into the server field, and add our user name. That should be it. We’ll click connect and provide our VNC password.</p>
<p>And we’re in. It’s not much, and the connection is rather slow but it’s a living, breathing, GUI desktop running on the Amazon cloud.</p>
