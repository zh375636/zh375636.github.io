It’s also intended for those interested in obtaining the Associate Cloud Engineer certification. </p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/google-cloud-platform-fundamentals-54/">basic understanding of the Google Cloud Platform</a> and its offerings. </p>
<p>We’ll kick off this course by covering <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/cloud-academy-introduction-to-kubernetes-92/">Kubernetes</a> Engine resources. You’ll learn how to deploy a Kubernetes Engine cluster and how to deploy a container application to Kubernetes Engine, using pods. Rounding out the first section, you’ll learn how to configure Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll dive into the deployment and implementation of App Engine and Cloud Functions resources. In this section, you’ll learn how to deploy an application to App Engine and how to deploy a Cloud Function that receives Google Cloud Events. </p>
<p>As we progress through the course, you’ll learn how to upload data to Google offerings such as cloud storage and cloud SQL. </p>
<p>After learning about deploying to Google cloud, you’ll learn how to deploy a solution using Cloud Launcher. You’ll learn about things like browsing the Cloud Launcher catalog and viewing solution details. You’ll also learn how to deploy a Cloud Launcher marketplace solution. </p>
<p>Rounding out the course, we’ll get into using Deployment Manager for deploying Applications. you’ll learn about using Deployment Manager templates, including how to use them to automate application deployment. </p>
<p>By the time you complete this course, you’ll have a full understanding of how to deploy and implement Google Cloud Platform solutions. </p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. So, if you’re ready to learn how to Deploy and Implement Google Cloud Platform Solutions, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Kubernetes-Engine-Clusters"><a href="#Kubernetes-Engine-Clusters" class="headerlink" title="Kubernetes Engine Clusters"></a>Kubernetes Engine Clusters</h1><p>Kubernetes Engine allows organizations to quickly develop and deploy containerized applications and services. It also makes it easy for organizations to update and manage those applications and services. Although stateless applications immediately come to mind when discussing containerized solutions, Kubernetes Engine isn’t just for stateless applications. As a matter of fact, you can run databases in a Kubernetes cluster, and you can even attach persistent storage to a cluster. </p>
<p>To leverage a Kubernetes Engine cluster, all you need to do is specify the compute memory and storage resources that your app container will need. Once you’ve done that, the Kubernetes Engine will provide and manage the underlying resources automatically. </p>
<p>You can create four types of clusters in Kubernetes Engine. They include zonal clusters, regional clusters, private clusters and alpha clusters. </p>
<p>A zonal cluster runs in one or more compute zones within a region. Multi-zone clusters run their nodes across two or more compute zones within a single region. I should also point out that any given zonal cluster will run a single cluster master. Regional clusters run three cluster masters across three different compute zones.</p>
<p>Regional clusters also run nodes in two or more compute zones. </p>
<p>A private cluster can be a zonal cluster or a regional cluster. Either way, a private cluster hides its cluster master and nodes from the public internet by default. </p>
<p>The fourth type of Kubernetes cluster is the alpha cluster. The alpha cluster is an experimental zonal or regional cluster that runs with alpha Kubernetes features enabled. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that alpha clusters expire after 30 days. It’s also important to note that they cannot be upgraded nor do they receive security updates. Most importantly, alpha clusters are not supported for production use. </p>
<p>When you use the GCP console to create a Kubernetes cluster, you’ll see all of the cluster templates that are available to you. The Standard template is selected by default. </p>
<p>The complete selection of templates includes the Standard cluster, Your first cluster, CPU intensive applications, Memory intensive applications, GPU accelerated computing, and Highly available. </p>
<p>As I mentioned, the Standard cluster template is the default selection. </p>
<p>Your first cluster is a small cluster that runs less powerful nodes. Some advanced features like autoscaling are disabled. </p>
<p>The CPU intensive applications template creates a cluster with nodes that offer more powerful multi-core CPUs than a standard cluster. </p>
<p>The Memory intensive applications template creates a cluster with moderately powerful multi-core CPUs and a large amount of memory. </p>
<p>GPU accelerated computing clusters feature a default node pool that’s configured with less powerful nodes, along with an additional GPU-enabled node pool. Autoscaling is disabled by default on clusters built from the GPU accelerated computing template. </p>
<p>The Highly available template creates a cluster that’s configured as a regional cluster. Cluster masters are available in each zone of a given region. Unlike the GPU accelerated computing cluster, autoscaling on a Highly available cluster is enabled by default. In addition, maintenance window is enabled as well. </p>
<p>In the next lesson, I’ll show you how to deploy a Kubernetes Engine cluster.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-a-Single-Zone-Cluster"><a href="#Creating-a-Single-Zone-Cluster" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Single-Zone Cluster"></a>Creating a Single-Zone Cluster</h1><p>In the previous lesson, we covered the different types of cluster templates that are available to us. In this demonstration, I’m going to create a single-zone cluster using one of those templates. To get started, I need to browse to the Google Kubernetes Engine menu in GCP console. From here, I just need to browse to Clusters and then click Create Cluster. </p>
<p>After clicking Create Cluster, I have several cluster templates to choose from, and they are here on the left hand side. We covered these templates in the earlier lesson, so I’m not going to bore you with them again. What I’m going to do for this exercise is choose the Standard cluster template. To customize my template, I need to provide a unique name for my cluster along with a location type. I’m going to call my cluster mygkecluster and I’m going to select Zonal for my location type. </p>
<p>After setting my zone type, I can specify the zone where I want to deploy my cluster here. </p>
<p>This master version dropdown allows me to choose the cluster master version for mygkecluster. The master version that I select here will determine the version of Cloud Run on GKE that is installed when I create the cluster. You should always use a version with the latest supported version of Cloud Run, so for this exercise, I’ll leave it at the default setting. </p>
<p>What I need to do here is specify my node pool settings. Each node pool is a separate instance group running Kubernetes in the cluster. </p>
<p>For this exercise, I’ll leave it set to three nodes, I’ll also need to specify the machine type to use for my instances. Now, I should point out that each machine type is built differently, so keep that in mind when deploying resources. As you can see here, the default machine type features one CPU and 3.75 gig of ram. I’m going to leave this at the default setting and then just click create to deploy my cluster. </p>
<p>Once I’ve created a cluster in the GCP console, I’ll need to configure kube control to interact with the cluster. To do this, I need to create a kubeconfig entry. To create this entry, I need to launch Cloud Shell. </p>
<p>Once this cluster is up and running, we’ll launch Cloud Shell and I’ll show you how to create a kubeconfig entry. Okay, now that our cluster has been created and is active, what I’ll do here is launch Cloud Shell, and let me paste the command down here. So like I was saying, what we need to do is create a kubeconfig entry for our cluster to allow kube control to interact with the cluster, so we can run commands against it. </p>
<p>This gcloud container clusters command, what it does is retrieves the credentials for mygkecluster, now when I run this command, I also have to specify the region in which the cluster resides, in this case, we deployed to the us-central1-a. So we’ll go ahead and hit Enter here. This command doesn’t return a whole lot of information, but what it does do is tell us that it’s fetching the cluster end-point and authentication data. It’s also telling me that the kubeconfig entry has been generated for mygkecluster, so by doing this, this allows me to later on, if I want to manage my cluster using kube control, I can use kube control to interact with the cluster, and since I’ve created the kubeconfig entry here, my deployment is now complete and I can run individual kube control commands against the cluster.</p>
<h1 id="Deploying-a-container-application-to-Kubernetes-Engine-using-pods"><a href="#Deploying-a-container-application-to-Kubernetes-Engine-using-pods" class="headerlink" title="Deploying a container application to Kubernetes Engine using pods"></a>Deploying a container application to Kubernetes Engine using pods</h1><p>In this lesson I’m going to explain how to deploy a container application to Kubernetes Engine using pods. After explaining the process, we’ll jump into a demo in the next lesson where I’ll show you how it’s done. </p>
<p>For this lesson and the next, we’ll take a basic web app as an example. We’ll run that web app on a Goggle Kubernetes Engine cluster. </p>
<p>When deploying a container app to Kubernetes using pods, you need to complete a series of steps. You first need to package the app into a Docker image. Once the app is packaged, you need to upload the image to a registry. From there, you need to create a container cluster to host the app. </p>
<p>With the container cluster created, you can then deploy the app to the cluster and then expose the app to the internet. </p>
<p>In the next lesson, I’m going to walk you through the process of deploying a containerized web app to Kubernetes Engine.</p>
<h1 id="Deploying-a-containerized-app-to-GKE-Cluster"><a href="#Deploying-a-containerized-app-to-GKE-Cluster" class="headerlink" title="Deploying a containerized app to GKE Cluster"></a>Deploying a containerized app to GKE Cluster</h1><p>Welcome back! In the previous lesson, I explained the process that you need to follow when deploying a containerized app to a GKE Cluster. In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to perform the deployment. </p>
<p>What we’re going to do here is deploy a containerized sample app, called “hello-app”. It’s a web app from the Google Container Registry. </p>
<p>Now before we get started, I need to use gcloud to configure to default settings: my default project and my compute zone. For this demonstration, I’m going to use my cloud academy project. And the compute zone I’m going to use is us-central1-a. </p>
<p>I should point out, that although configuring these two settings isn’t mandatory, doing so makes it easier to run gcloud commands later on. </p>
<p>So, let’s get started. </p>
<p>What I need to do here is launch cloud shell, so I can set my default project. So, we’ll go ahead and launch it. What I’ll do here is make it a little bit bigger, so we can see it here. </p>
<p>To set my default project, I need to run the gcloud config set command. So, I’ll type this out here. </p>
<p>Now, I’m going to set the actually project I.D.. This sets my default project to my cloud academy project. Next, I need to set my default compute zone. To do this, I run the gcloud config set command. And then, what I’m going to do is set the compute zone. And I’m gonna specify us-central1-a. You can see here that it updated my compute zone as well. So, with my project and compute zone set, I can begin working on the deployment. </p>
<p>Before deploying anything, I need to get authentication credentials for my cluster. In this demo, I’m gonna to deploy to the cluster called “my GKE Cluster”, which I created earlier in this course. To get my authentication credentials to interact with the cluster, I need to run gcloud container clusters to get credentials. So, lets type that out here. And then I need to specify my cluster. Now, what this command does is configure cube control to use the cluster that I created earlier. </p>
<p>At this point, I’m ready to deploy my containerized app. Now, as I mentioned earlier, I’m going to deploy a sample web application from the Google container registry. This app is called “hello app”. </p>
<p>To run “hello-app” in my cluster, I need to use cube control run to create deployment. What I’m going to do here is just paste in the full command and then explain what’s going on. This cube control one command creates a new deployment named “hello-server”. The deployment’s pod will then run the “hello-app” image in its container. The image flag specifies the container image to deploy. In this example, the image is being pulled from the Google container registry. The 1.O suffix specifies the image version to pull. The port flag is used to specify a port that the container needs to expose for the app to be accessible. </p>
<p>Now, hitting Enter here, launches the deployment. Now, after a few moments, you can see here the deployment is complete. But, I still have to expose it to the internet, so that users can get to it. This is done by creating a service that exposes the app to external traffic. To expose “hello app” to the world, I need to use the cube control expose command. </p>
<p>Now, I’m going to again copy this over because its a longer command. What this command does is create a compute engine load balancer for my container. And it does this via the “type” flag. The “port” flag initializes public port 80 to the internet. And the target port flag, routes inbound traffic to port 8080 of the application. So, we’ll go ahead and hit enter here. </p>
<p>We can see here that it tells me that service hello-server is exposed. Now, to test my app deployment, I need to browse to it in a browser. However, I first need to find out what its public IP address is. To do this, I can run cube control get, and specify my deployment. Now, we can see here it’s still pending an external IP address. So, we’ll give this a few minutes for it to complete and get its IP. This can sometimes take a minute or two. I’ll quickly re-run it again. And we can see that we’ve gotten an external IP now. </p>
<p>So, I’ll copy this and with this external IP, I can browse to it in a browser and confirm that it works. So, I’ll open up an incognito window here. And as you can see here on your screen, my app is in fact, working. </p>
<p>So, Congratulations! You now know how to deploy a containerized web application to GKE.</p>
<h1 id="Configuring-Kubernetes-Engine-application-monitoring-and-logging"><a href="#Configuring-Kubernetes-Engine-application-monitoring-and-logging" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging"></a>Configuring Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging</h1><p>When you enable logging for a Kubernetes cluster, the logs are stored in a dedicated, persistent datastore. Such logs include the admin activity log, the data access log, and the events log. </p>
<p>These logs include information on several types of GKE-related resource types. For example, when you enable monitoring and logging, you’ll start capturing information about the Kubernetes cluster itself, as well as for GKE cluster operations. You’ll also capture data for the GKE container and for GKE node pool operations. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that although GKE stores these logs, these logs are not stored permanently. For example, if you remove a pod, the GKE container logs associated with this pod are also removed. Logs are also removed when the disk on which the logs are stored runs out of space, or when logs are overwritten by newer logs. </p>
<p>You should also be aware that logging is actually a Google Cloud Platform service that’s separate from GKE. </p>
<p>In the next lesson, I’ll show you how to enable Kubernetes monitoring and logging.</p>
<h1 id="Enabling-Kubernetes-Monitoring-and-Logging"><a href="#Enabling-Kubernetes-Monitoring-and-Logging" class="headerlink" title="Enabling Kubernetes Monitoring and Logging"></a>Enabling Kubernetes Monitoring and Logging</h1><p>When you sit the GCP exam, you may find yourself being asked to enable Kubernetes monitoring or logging. In this brief demonstration, I’m going to show you how to enable Stackdriver logging and monitoring for an existing Kubernetes cluster. </p>
<p>To do this, let’s browse to the Clusters page under Kubernetes Engine. From here, I can click the Edit icon to edit my cluster. Now, to enable both logging and monitoring, I just have to choose Enable from the Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring dropdown. So if I scroll down here, we can see it right here, so we’ll go ahead and enable this. </p>
<p>Now you might notice right here, there are also two other options. These Legacy options for monitoring and logging are also supported. However, Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring is the preferred option, beginning with GKE versions 1.12.7 and 1.13, while Legacy Stackdriver is the default option up through GKE version 1.13. </p>
<p>Because these Legacy options aren’t getting any future improvements, nor do they offer features that are present in Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring, you should use the Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring whenever possible. We’ll go ahead and set this back to enabled again, and you’ll see here that when I enable the Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring, I can’t use the Legacy options, and that’s because they’re not compatible. </p>
<p>So having said that, I’m going to click Save down here at the bottom, to enable monitoring and logging for my cluster. And we can see here our Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring is now enabled, and our Legacy are disabled, so that’s pretty much it. We now have Stackdriver logging and monitoring enabled for our existing Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<h1 id="Deploying-an-application-to-App-Engine"><a href="#Deploying-an-application-to-App-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Deploying an application to App Engine"></a>Deploying an application to App Engine</h1><p>Google App Engine allows you to build and deploy applications on a completely managed platform. It allows you to scale applications seamlessly, without having to deal with underlying infrastructure. App Engine automatically scales, depending on traffic, and it only consumes resources when your code is running. This means that you only need to pay for the resources that you consume. &#x3D;</p>
<p>In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to deploy a basic web application to Google App Engine. </p>
<p>To do this I need to create a new project on Google Cloud platform. To create a new project, I need to go to the Google Cloud platform console, and then go up here and click New Project.</p>
<p>I need to provide a name for my project and I need to note it’s project ID. For this demonstration I’m going to call my project “GAE Demo Site”. And I’m going to assign it a project ID of GAE Demo Site 007.</p>
<p>I’ll just click the Create button here to create my project.</p>
<p>And then I’ll go into my project here. Now each cloud platform project can contain one App Engine Application. So what I’m going to do here is prepare an app for our project. What I have on my desktop is a sample PHP app that I’m going to publish.</p>
<p>If we look at it here, we could see that the website folder contains our website content. Now, the app file, or the app.yaml file here, this is the application configuration file for our app that we’re going to publish. This file tells App Engine how to map the URLs to our static files in our website. So let me close this, and go back to desktop here. </p>
<p>So, now that we have our project created and we have our sample app files in hand, we can publish our PHP web app to our App Engine. </p>
<p>Now to do this, we need to launch Google Cloud Shell. With Google Cloud Shell opened we’ll need to launch the code editor, and then drag and drop our My App folder into the left pane. So let’s minimize this. Launch our Cloud Shell here. And I’ll expand this a little bit. And then what we’ll do is we’ll launch our editor here. So let’s minimize my template demo here, and let’s go ahead and drag my app into my editor. So now we can see my app is now up in my explorer. </p>
<p>What we need to do now is select our project that we created earlier. Now you can see here, the Google Cloud Platform project in this session is already set to GAE Demo Site 007, but what I want to do is show you the command that you would use to set your project if you had to. What you do is you run a G Cloud config command here, and we’ll just type it out here. And then we do a set project. And then we’ll call it GAE demo site 007. It essentially tells us it updated the property for the core project. So with our project set, we can now switch over to our My App directory by typing the CD My App command. This switches us over to the directory that we uploaded into our explorer. We could deploy our app from this directory, by running the G Cloud App deploy from our prompt. So what we’ll do here is do g cloud app deploy. And what this is going to do is upload our app to App Engine. Now as you can see here we’re being prompted to choose a region where we want our app to be located. I’m just going to choose option thirteen here for US East one.</p>
<p>Now what this is doing is creating the App Engine application in our project in the US East region. Now at this point it’s going to ask me if I’m sure or if I want to continue, and of course we do. So we’ll hit Y and Enter. And at this point it begins the deployment. We can see that the file uploads are completed, and now it’s updating the service. Now this is a pretty basic application, so you can see that the process is already complete. Now since this upload is done and the process is completed, I can test my application by browsing to GAE Demo Site 007 dot app spot dot com. So I’m going to copy this from offscreen here, because I don’t feel like typing it out. And what we’ll do is we’ll open incognito here.</p>
<p>And then we can see here that our application is now live. So by leveraging App Engine, I can focus on my app code, rather than infrastructure, and this essentially is the whole point of the App Engine service.</p>
<h1 id="App-Versioning"><a href="#App-Versioning" class="headerlink" title="App Versioning"></a>App Versioning</h1><p>In the next lesson, I’m going to talk about traffic splitting when deploying multiple app versions. That being the case, I just wanted to briefly touch on the deployment of multiple app versions. However, because the deployment process for multiple versions is identical to the deployment of the first version, I’m not going to do a full demonstration. Instead, I’m just going to tell you that to deploy multiple versions of an app, you can simply rerun the gcloud app deploy command that we covered in the last lesson. By doing so, another copy of the app will be deployed and GCP will automatically generate a version for it. You can rerun the gcloud app deploy to create as many versions of your application that you need. If you need a different configuration for each version, as will be the case when doing A&#x2F;B testing, you would just modify the configuration of the web app and then rerun the gcloud app deploy command. </p>
<p>So, with that said, let’s hop into the next lesson so I can explain traffic splitting.</p>
<h1 id="Traffic-Splitting"><a href="#Traffic-Splitting" class="headerlink" title="Traffic Splitting"></a>Traffic Splitting</h1><p>In previous lessons, you learned how to deploy an app to the GCP app service and how to deploy multiple versions of the app. When you deploy multiple app versions, you can split traffic across them. What you can do is specify a percentage of traffic that should go to one version and another percentage that should go to another version or even several other versions within a service. </p>
<p>Traffic splitting is a great way to conduct A&#x2F;B testing between different versions and it provides more control over the process of rolling out features. </p>
<p>You can split traffic by IP address or via cookie splitting. You can also configure random splitting. </p>
<p>If you decide to split traffic by IP address, the application, when it receives a request, hashes the IP address to a value between zero and 999. It then uses that number to route the request to a version of your app. </p>
<p>When cooking splitting, the application will look in the HTTP request header for a cookie named GOOGAPPUID. This cookie contains a value between zero and 999. If the cookie exists, the value is used to route the request. In the event there is no cookie, the request is routed randomly. </p>
<p>Randomly splitting traffic results in a split that’s based on a weighted random assignment. Incoming requests are randomly routed to a version of the app in the traffic split. </p>
<p>In the next demonstration, I’m going to show you how to split traffic across two versions of an app hosted by app service.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Configure-Traffic-Splitting"><a href="#How-to-Configure-Traffic-Splitting" class="headerlink" title="How to Configure Traffic Splitting"></a>How to Configure Traffic Splitting</h1><p>Welcome back. In the last lesson we talked a little bit about traffic splitting. What I want to do here is show you how to do it via the console. It’s actually rather easy to do, but it makes sense to demonstrate how it’s done. </p>
<p>As you can see here on your screen, I’m in the app engine dashboard. What I’m going to do here is click over here on Versions. Now what this shows is two versions of my app that I deployed earlier. If you notice, only one of these apps is receiving all of the traffic. </p>
<p>To split traffic across both of these versions, I just need to click Split Traffic up here at the top, and then from here I can choose my split option. For this exercise I’m going to choose Random. Clicking Add version allows me to add my second version of the app to the split, and then from here I can configure the split percentages. </p>
<p>With my split configured, I just have to click Save to save my split configuration. Now what this configuration does is randomly split traffic evenly across both versions of my application, and if we go back here, we can see the 50-50 split. </p>
<p>So that, in a nutshell, is how you configure traffic splitting across multiple versions of an application.</p>
<h1 id="Deploying-a-Cloud-Function-that-receives-Google-Cloud-events"><a href="#Deploying-a-Cloud-Function-that-receives-Google-Cloud-events" class="headerlink" title="Deploying a Cloud Function that receives Google Cloud events"></a>Deploying a Cloud Function that receives Google Cloud events</h1><p>Google Cloud Functions is an event-driven serverless compute platform that allows you to run serverless code in the cloud. It automatically scales and requires no server provisioning. The way it works is simple. When a cloud service emits an event, Cloud Functions responds to the event and then invokes other services and APIs as necessary. It then writes back to the cloud service. </p>
<p>In this lesson, I’m going to demonstrate how to deploy a Cloud Function that receives Google Cloud events using a Pub&#x2F;Sub trigger. </p>
<p>What we’re going to do is deploy a background cloud function called helloworld and then trigger the function by publishing a message to a Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub topic called mytopic. </p>
<p>To prepare for this demo, I’ve already created a topic called mytopic in Google Cloud Platform. I’ve also downloaded the helloworld sample function from GitHub and extracted it to my laptop. </p>
<p>You can see the helloworld sample function folder here on my screen. </p>
<p>In order to make this stuff all work, what I need to do is launch my Cloud Shell and open up the Code Editor because what I want to do is upload the helloworld folder which contains my function to Google Cloud Platform. So let’s go ahead and launch the Cloud Shell here and then what I’ll do is I’ll launch Code Editor here. </p>
<p>So now that I have my Shell and Code Editor opened here, let me drag my helloworld folder into my Explorer here. Now we’re doing this because this is where I’m going to deploy from. </p>
<p>To deploy our function with a Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub trigger, I need to run the G Cloud Functions deploy command. However, I need to run the command in the directory that I uploaded my function to so let me switch over to the helloworld directory first here. </p>
<p>Now that I’m in the helloworld directory, I can run the G Cloud Functions deploy command. What I’ll do here is copy and paste this command in and then I’ll explain it. </p>
<p>Notice the name that I’m using for the trigger topic flag. It’s the topic that I created ahead of this demo that’s called mytopic. I’m going to call my function deployment hello_pubsub. You can also see in this command that I’m specifying the Python 3.7 runtime. Let’s go ahead and deploy. And we can see here that my deployment has completed. </p>
<p>Now the function that I just deployed is going to check mytopic for messages. I can trigger the function by publishing a message to mytopic. For this example, the message that I publish is simply going to be my name. The function will then include my name in a greeting message. To publish my message which will in turn trigger my function, I need to run the G Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub topics publish command and let me copy it over here so you can see what it looks like. I’m going to expand this window a little bit. There we go. </p>
<p>Essentially what we’re doing here is we’re publishing a message with the name Thomas to the mytopic topic. So let’s go ahead and publish our message here. Okay, so we have our message published to our topic. Now that I’ve published my message, I can check the logs to make sure that the process has actually completed, that the message was actually sent. To do this, I need to run the G Cloud Functions logs read command that I’m going to copy in now. </p>
<p>What this does is allow me to read the logs that have been generated. Now what the limit flag does here is limit the return of the logs to the last 50. And let’s hit Enter a few times here to bring this up. Now as you can see on your screen, there is a message here that displays Hello Thomas. This tells me that my function is working as expected because that’s exactly what it was supposed to do. Now if you want to perform this demo in your own environment, visit the first URL that you see on your screen and follow the instructions for creating a topic called mytopic in GCP. </p>
<p>To download the sample helloworld function that I used in this demo, visit the second URL to download it. Extract the downloaded zip file and copy the helloworld folder to your desktop. The helloworld folder is located in the functions subfolder within python-docs-samples master. Once you’ve created a topic called mytopic and extracted the helloworld folder that contains the sample function, you can pick up at the beginning of this demo and do it yourself.</p>
<h1 id="Loading-data-into-Cloud-Storage"><a href="#Loading-data-into-Cloud-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Loading data into Cloud Storage"></a>Loading data into Cloud Storage</h1><p>There are many ways to load data into your Cloud Storage Bucket. You can use the command line, APIs, the console, and even various programming languages such as Python, PHP, Ruby, and more. </p>
<p>To load data into Google Cloud using the console, open the Cloud Storage browser in the Google Cloud Platform Console and then, while viewing the list of buckets, click the bucket that you want to upload data to. From the bucket’s Objects tab, you can drag and drop your files from your workstation to the main pane in the GCP Console. However, you can also just click the Upload Files button, and then choose the files that you need to upload, and then click Open. </p>
<p>Either way, uploading data into GCP from your workstation, using the console, is pretty straightforward. </p>
<p>You can also use the command line to get data into Google Cloud. To upload data to Google Cloud using the command line, you need to leverage gsutil. To upload data using gsutil, run the gsutil cp command that you see on your screen. </p>
<p>What you’d need to do is replace OBJECT_LOCATION with the folder on your workstation that hosts the data you want to upload. You’d replace DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME with the name of the bucket you are uploading to. </p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to upload finances.txt from my desktop, I’d replace OBJECT_LOCATION with Desktop&#x2F;finances.txt. If I wanted to upload to a bucket named mybucket, I’d replace [DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME] with mybucket. </p>
<p>My full command would look like the one that you now see on your screen. </p>
<p>If you need, or want, to upload data to GCP using APIs, you have two main choices. You can leverage the JSON API or the XML API. </p>
<p>In either case, you first need to obtain an authorization access token from the OAuth 2.0 Playground, and then configure the playground to use your OAuth credentials. </p>
<p>Once you’ve got your OAuth credentials configured, you can use the API of your choice to upload data. </p>
<p>If using the JSON API, you need to use curl with a POST command to upload your data. The sample code on your screen would upload a file named photo.png from the desktop to a bucket called mybucket. </p>
<p>OAUTH2_TOKEN would be replaced with the access token that you obtained from the OAuth 2.0 Playground. If using the XML API, you need to use curl with a PUT command to upload your data. The sample code on your screen would upload a file named photo.png from the desktop to a bucket called mybucket. Again OAUTH2_TOKEN would be replaced with the access token that you obtained from the OAuth 2.0 Playground. </p>
<p>So, as you can see, there are quite a few ways to get data into Google Cloud. In a production setting, you’d obviously use whatever method works for what you are trying to accomplish.</p>
<h1 id="Initializing-a-Data-System-with-Products"><a href="#Initializing-a-Data-System-with-Products" class="headerlink" title="Initializing a Data System with Products"></a>Initializing a Data System with Products</h1><p>There may be times when you need to upload data to other services, such as Cloud SQL. For example, you may want to initialize your data system with an inventory of products. In this demonstration, I’m going to show you how to connect to a Cloud SQL instance, how to create a database, and then how to upload data to that database. </p>
<p>We’ll do this via Cloud Shell. </p>
<p>Now to prepare for this exercise, I’ve already provisioned a MySQL instance, called myinstance. </p>
<p>To connect to myinstance and upload my data or initialize that seed data, I’m going to launch my Cloud Shell. Let’s go ahead and do that here. Let’s drag this up here. </p>
<p>Now, from the Cloud Shell prompt, I’m going to run a gcloud SQL connect command here. So let’s type it in here. Now what this is going to do is white-list my IP address so I can connect to SQL. </p>
<p>As you can see here, I am prompted for the root password that I created when I created the instance. So I’ll go ahead and enter it here. </p>
<p>Now once I’ve done that, I’m presented with the MySQL prompt. Now to create my SQL database, I need to run a create command. So let’s go ahead and do that now. We’ll type in create and then database and we’ll call it mydatabase. We can see by the query OK that my database creation was successful. </p>
<p>Now that my database is created, I can begin uploading data, but before I do that, I need to create a table and to do that, I need to use the create table command. Now before running the create table command, I’m going to run a use command to make sure I’m using my database. So now we’re connected to my database. What this use command does is essentially specify the database that I want to work with. </p>
<p>Now with my database selected, I need to create my table. Now what I’m going to do here is I’m going to copy the create table command over because it’s rather lengthy. This create table command creates a table within my database and creates three columns within that table. It creates a product name column, a content column, and an entry ID column. It also sets the entry ID column as the primary key for the table. </p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and hit Enter here to create our table. And we can see that the query is OK so we’re good. So with my table created, I’m going to run an insert command to add an apple as a product and red delicious as the content for that apple. And what I’ll do here is I’ll copy it over. So you can see what we’re going to do is run an INSERT INTO command to insert data into our entries table. Now the entries table is the table that we created up here. </p>
<p>What we’re going to do is insert apple as our product name and red delicious, which is a type of apple, as the content. So essentially what we’re going to do is build an inventory or initialize an inventory of products. So we’ll go ahead and hit Enter here. And we can see our query was OK with one row affected. Now I’ll run the same command again to add another type of apple into my inventory. This time we’ll do a Cortland apple. So as you can see here, this is how I can initialize something like an inventory system with product using basic insert commands. </p>
<p>Now to retrieve the data that I entered, I simply run a select command. So what we’ll do is we’ll run select and then we’ll specify star, which means return everything, and we’ll select from our entries table. I forgot my semicolon. And there we go. And just to show you what happened here, when I ran the select command, I forgot the trailing semicolon here to denote the end of the command, so it was looking for more info. And that’s what it’s telling me here. We had an error in our SQL syntax but once I ran the command correctly, select star from entries semicolon, it returns all of the entries from our entries table. </p>
<p>And we can see here apple as our product name, red delicious. Apple as another productive name and Cortland. Now of course this is a simple demonstration, but it does give you an idea of what’s involved in creating databases and initializing them with product data.</p>
<h1 id="Developing-Deployment-Manager-templates-to-automate-deployment-of-an-application"><a href="#Developing-Deployment-Manager-templates-to-automate-deployment-of-an-application" class="headerlink" title="Developing Deployment Manager templates to automate deployment of an application"></a>Developing Deployment Manager templates to automate deployment of an application</h1><p>Although basic configuration files can be used to deploy less complex workloads, more complex workloads and configurations that you plan to reuse should be handled with templates. A deployment manager template is a file that’s imported and used as a type in a configuration. Deployment manager templates allow you to break out a configuration into multiple pieces that you can reuse with different solution deployments. In this lesson, I’m going to show you a basic deployment manager template and its architecture. The template we’re going to look at is called demovm.jinja. We’ll use it later in this course to deploy a VM. On the screen, you can see our basic demovm deployment template in Jinja format. I created this in preparation for this exercise. In this template, we’re defining the name of our VM instance with the name value. In addition to providing a name for our VM, we need to specify the type of resource we’re deploying. We do this with the type value. Since we’re deploying a VM instance, we need to specify compute.v1.instance as the type. Using the properties value, we need to specify the zone where we want to deploy to and the machine type. In this example, we’re deploying an n1-standard-1 machine to the us-central1-a region. The disks value allows us to specify disk information. For this exercise, we’re specifying a persistent boot disk called boot and we’re configuring the disk for autoDelete so that it’s removed when the VM instance is removed. Under initializeParams, we’re using the sourceImage value to tell GCP that we want to deploy a debian-9 virtual machine. With the networkInterfaces setting, we’re configuring the VM to connect to the default network. In the next lesson, we’ll compare configuration files with deployment manager templates. After that, we’ll deploy a VM from our demovm deployment manager template.</p>
<h1 id="Configuration-Files-vs-Deployment-Manager-Templates"><a href="#Configuration-Files-vs-Deployment-Manager-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Configuration Files vs Deployment Manager Templates"></a>Configuration Files vs Deployment Manager Templates</h1><p>Before we get into the process of deploying a resource using a deployment manager template, I wanted to quickly explain what the configuration file is and what its relationship is to the template because before using a template to deploy a resource, we must first create a configuration. </p>
<p>Now, what a configuration file is is a list of resources, and their respective properties that will be part of the deployment. A configuration file contains a top-level resources section, which, in turn, contains a list of resource entries that are used to configure the deployment. Each resource entry includes a name field, a type field, and sometimes, a properties field. </p>
<p>On the screen, here, you can see what a typical configuration file looks like, when using a template for deployment. The information you see is from a configuration file, called myvm.yaml, that I created ahead of this lesson. If you remember the previous lesson, where I showed you the demovm deployment manager template, you’ll recall that I specified all the necessary values for our VM in the demovm.jinja file. </p>
<p>Since we already configured these values in the template file we’ll be using, we don’t have to provide this information directly in the configuration file here. Instead, we’ll simply pull this information from our template into the configuration, using the imports command, along with a path designation. </p>
<p>Since both my config file and template both reside in the same templatedemo folder, I don’t need to specify a complete path. The name field in the resources section is used to specify a name for the resource being deployed. </p>
<p>For this exercise, we’re calling our new VM myfirstvm. Type specifies the base type of the resource being deployed. Since we already defined the type in our template that we’re referencing, we just need to configure the type to reference our template. As you can see here, the config file is pretty bare, when using templates. This makes sense because all the configuration settings are defined in the template file meaning there isn’t much needed in the config file. </p>
<p>So, now that I’ve explained the config file and template file, let’s hop into the next lesson where I’ll show you how to deploy a VM using a combination of the config file and template.</p>
<h1 id="Deploying-a-VM-via-a-Deployment-Manager-Template"><a href="#Deploying-a-VM-via-a-Deployment-Manager-Template" class="headerlink" title="Deploying a VM via a Deployment Manager Template"></a>Deploying a VM via a Deployment Manager Template</h1><p>Over the last two lessons, we covered the creation of a deployment manager template file and we also covered the role of the configuration file. In this lesson, I’m going show you how to combine the two to deploy a VM instance. </p>
<p>So, let’s get started. </p>
<p>Before I do anything, I need to decide which project I’m going to use, since Deployment Manager requires a GCP Console project to be specified. For this exercise, I’m using my existing Cloud Academy project. </p>
<p>I’m going to run this deployment from Google Cloud Shell, which comes with gcloud installed. Gcloud is what we are going to use to deploy our template. </p>
<p>To run my deployment from Cloud Shell, I need to launch the shell and then launch the code editor window. So let’s go ahead and activate Cloud Shell. And then we’ll launch the code editor window. </p>
<p>At this point, I need to drag my templatedemo folder from my workstation into the explorer here in code editor. This will allow me to run my commands and to access the files that they reference. So let me go down here and open my Desktop here. </p>
<p>You can see here that my templatedemo folder, and everything in it, is now up in cloud shell </p>
<p>So, now that I have everything in my environment set up, I can begin my deployment. </p>
<p>What I’m going to do here is change to my templatedemo directory and then run my deployment from there since that’s where my files are. To run my deployment here, using the demovm template that I showed you earlier, I need to run the command that I’m going to show you here on your screen. And I’ll copy this in here ‘cause it’s a long command. So what we’re going to do here is we’re going to use gcloud deployment-manager to create a deployment called myvm-with-templates and we’re going to configure that deployment using the myvm.yaml file. </p>
<p>When this deployment runs, my config file will import that template and remember the config file is the YAML file. And that’s going to import the ginger file which is the template via the imports section that was added to that configuration file and we covered that earlier. So we’ll go ahead and hit Enter here. And we can see the deployment begins. </p>
<p>Now if we switch over to the console here and go into compute engine, we can see my first VM being deployed. Let’s switch back over to Cloud Shell here and we’ll continue with the deployment. Now, this’ll take a few minutes to complete and we can see here that it’s completed with no errors. </p>
<p>What I’m going to do now is run the gcloud deployment-manager command that we’re going to pull in here and what this command is going to do is allow me to view my deployment. So let me pull this command in here. We’re calling gcloud deployment manager and we’re using the deployments command and instead of using a create, we’re using a describe and essentially what this is doing is telling Deployment Manager to show me the deployment called myvm-with -emplates. So we’ll go ahead and hit Enter here. </p>
<p>And as you can see here, this command returns my deployment information. We can see the name, the end time, the operation type, the progress of the deployment when it started and its status. We can also see who ran it. At the bottom here we can see the status is complete. So, with that, you now know how to create a basic VM deployment using a template!</p>
<h1 id="Course-Conclusion-Deploying-and-Implementing-Google-Cloud-Platform-Solutions"><a href="#Course-Conclusion-Deploying-and-Implementing-Google-Cloud-Platform-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Course Conclusion: Deploying and Implementing Google Cloud Platform Solutions"></a>Course Conclusion: Deploying and Implementing Google Cloud Platform Solutions</h1><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/deploying-and-implementing-google-cloud-platform-solutions/course-intro-deploying-and-implementing-google-cloud-platform-solutions/">Deploying and Implementing Google Cloud Platform Solutions</a>. Let’s review what you’ve learned. </p>
<p>We began the course with Kubernetes Engine resources. You learned how to deploy a Kubernetes Engine cluster, and how to deploy a container application to Kubernetes Engine using pods. Closing out the first section, you learned how to configure Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging. </p>
<p>Next, we covered the deployment and implementation of App Engine and Cloud Functions resources. In this section, you learned how to deploy an application to App Engine and how to deploy a Cloud Function that receives Google Cloud Events. </p>
<p>As we progressed through this course, you learned how to upload data into Google Cloud solutions such as Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL. </p>
<p>After learning how to upload data, you learned how to deploy a solution using Cloud Launcher. You learned about things like browsing the Cloud Launcher catalog, and viewing solution details. You also learned how to deploy a Cloud Launcher marketplace solution. </p>
<p>Rounding out the course, we talked about using Deployment Manager for deploying applications. You learned about using Deployment Manager templates, including how to use them to automate deployments. </p>
<p>At this point, you should now have a full understanding of how to deploy and implement Google Cloud Platform solutions. </p>
<p>To learn more about deploying and implementing Google Cloud Platform solutions, you can and should read Google’s documentation. Be sure to also watch for new courses on Cloud Academy, because we’re always publishing new ones. Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching, and happy learning.</p>
