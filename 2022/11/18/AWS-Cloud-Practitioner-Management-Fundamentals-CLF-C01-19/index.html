<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course on Management Fundamentals in AWS, where we’re here to help you on your journey to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Danny Jessee, and I am one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS – Amazon Web Services – and AWS certifications. In this course, the AWS team will be presenting a series of lectures that introduce some management services currently available in AWS that may be covered on the exam. Feel free to contact me with any questions using the details shown on the screen, or you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x73;&#x75;&#112;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#117;&#100;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>, where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>This course has been specifically curated to help you pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and is ideal for anyone who is looking to learn more about the various management services in AWS in preparation for the exam. Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a great first step for anyone looking to grow within their current career, or transition to a new career entirely.</p>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide a high-level introduction to various management services in AWS that can assist with auditing, reporting, and monitoring within your AWS environments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS CloudTrail,</li>
<li>AWS Config, and</li>
<li>Amazon CloudWatch.</li>
</ul>
<p>These services are covered by Domain 2 in the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam blueprint: Security and Compliance, which accounts for 25% of the exam content. The other courses in this learning path cover the remaining exam content and will ensure that you are fully prepared to sit this exam.</p>
<p>This course is designed for anyone who is new to cloud computing, so no prior experience with AWS is necessary. While it may be helpful to have a basic understanding of AWS and its services, as well as some exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and operations, this is not required as all of the concepts we will introduce in this course will be explained and reinforced from the ground up.</p>
<p>Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content current to provide the best training available. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, or if you notice anything that needs to be updated or corrected for the next release cycle, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>. Thank you!</p>
<h1 id="AWS-CloudTrail"><a href="#AWS-CloudTrail" class="headerlink" title="AWS CloudTrail"></a>AWS CloudTrail</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture I will explain the basic fundamentals of AWS CloudTrail to give you an overview of the service before we look deeper at the inner workings, revealing how the different elements work together. So what is CloudTrail and what does it do? CloudTrail is a service that has a primary function to record and track all AWS API requests made. These API calls can be programmatic requests initiated from a user using an SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface, from within the AWS management console, or even from a request made by another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> service.</p>
<p>For example, when auto scaling automatically sends and API request to launch or terminate an instance. These API requests are all recorded by CloudTrail. When an API request is initiated, AWS CloudTrail captures the request as an event and records this event within a log file, which is then stored on S3. Each API call represents a new event within the log file. CloudTrail also records and associates other identifying metadata with all the events.</p>
<p>For example, the identity of the caller, the timestamp of when the request was initiated, and the source IP address. In a later lecture entitled Insight Into CloudTrail Logs, I will look at these log files deeper, while I’ll provide an example of a log file showing the different attributes recorded. For greater management, new log files are typically created every five minutes. Which are then delivered and stored within an S3 bucket that is defined by you during your CloudTrail configuration.</p>
<p>This allows you to easily go back and review the history of all API requests made. There’s also an option to have these logs delivered to a CloudWatch Logs log file as well. Having this association with CloudWatch enables custom metrics to be converted to monitor specific API requests. Thresholds can be set against these metrics and when crossed, the simple notification service, SNS, can be triggered to notify your security teams to investigate. That, at a very high level, is the overall function of the AWS CloudTrail service.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the CloudTrail architecture to understand where it can be implemented from an AWS region standpoint, and which services can be supported. AWS CloudTrail is a global service with support for all regions. Support for the latest region, EU London was added in mid December, 2016. In addition to this worldwide coverage, CloudTrail also provides support for over 60 AWS services and features across a wide-range of service categories.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, with this extensive coverage, CloudTrail can capture a vast amount of data if you have a multi-region, multi-service infrastructure environment deployed. So armed with this information, what can you do with it? How can you use this data to help you manage and support your AWS infrastructure? Well there are a number of ways you can use the data captured by CloudTrail to help you enhance your AWS environment. Firstly, and as mentioned earlier, it can be used very effectively as a security analysis tool. CloudTrail events provide very specific information about where an API call originated from and who, or what initiated the request.</p>
<p>As a result, if malicious activity was detected via irregular trends or restricted API call thresholds, with the use of CloudWatch, then a number of security controls can be quickly implemented to prevent the user from causing additional damage. Another common use for CloudTrail is to help resolve and manage day to day operational issues and problems. Using built-in filtering mechanisms, it’s possible to quickly find who, what and when a particular API was used, which could have potentially caused an outage or service interruption. This enables quicker root cause identification, resulting in a speedy resolution.</p>
<p>Appropriate actions can then be taken to ensure the incident does not reoccur in your environment. As API calls to add, modify or delete results are captured CloudTrail can be an effective method of tracking changes to resources within your environment. There is another AWS service that is specifically designed to order and track changes to resources, which is called AWS Config, which CloudTrail interacts with, however, CloudTrail can be used to capture the actual API request, and all associated data which made the change. And if you’re not using AWS Config then this at least provides some base level of monitoring and tracking.</p>
<p>From a governance and security legislation perspective, many certifications require the ability to recall and provide evidence of log files relating to specific changes to resources. CloudTrail provides all of this by default, through the use of capturing events and writing them to a log file, which is then stored on S3. AWS has a great whitepaper on achieving compliance, using CloudTrail entitled Logging in AWS, How AWS CloudTrail Can Help You Achieve Compliance by logging API calls and Changes to Resources.</p>
<p>The following URL will take you to that whitepaper. If you need to be able to capture and track API requests within your AWS account, for any of these reasons mentioned, or perhaps for other reasons you may have of your own, then CloudTrail can do this for you and deliver the output as a log file into an S3 bucket of your choice.</p>

<h1 id="AWS-Config"><a href="#AWS-Config" class="headerlink" title="AWS Config"></a>AWS Config</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where we will talk about the AWS Config service, itself, what it is, and what it does. So let’s get started. As many of you will be aware, one of the biggest headaches in any organization when it comes to resource management of IT infrastructure is understanding the following: What resources do we have? What devices are out there within our infrastructure performing functions? Do we have resources that are no longer needed and therefore can we be saving money by switching them off? What is the status of their current configuration?</p>
<p>Are there any security vulnerabilities we need to worry about? How are our resources linked within the environment? What relationships are there and are there any dependencies? If we make a change to one resource, will this effect another? What changes have occurred on the resources and by whom? Do we have a history of changes for this resource that shows us how the resource has changed over time? Is the infrastructure compliant with specific governance controls and how can we check to ensure that this configuration is meeting specific internal and external requirements?</p>
<p>And do we have accurate auditing information that can be passed to external auditors for compliance checks? Depending on the size of your deployment with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a>, trying to answer some of these questions can be very time-consuming and laborious. Some of this information can be captured by the AWS CLI by performing a describe, or list, against the specific resource. But implementing a system to capture those results and output them into a readable format could be very resource-intensive.</p>
<p>And of course, this will only help you with a small piece of the puzzle. AWS is aware that due to the very nature of the cloud and its benefits, the resources within an AWS environment are likely to fluctuate frequently, along with the configurations of the resources. The cloud by its very nature is designed to do so, and so trying to keep up with the resource management can be a struggle. Because of this, AWS released AWS Config to help with this very task.</p>
<p>The service has been designed to record and capture resource changes within your environment, allowing you to perform a number of actions against the data that helps to find answers to the questions that we highlighted previously. So what did AWS design AWS Config to do? Well, in a nutshell, AWS Config can capture resource changes. So any change to a resource supported by Config can be recorded, which will record what change along with other useful metadata all held within a file known as a configuration item, a CI.</p>
<p>It can act as a resource inventory. AWS Config can discover supported resources running within your environment, allowing you to see data about that resource type. You can store configuration history for individual resources. The service will record and hold all existing changes that have happened against the resource, providing a useful history record of changes. It can provide a snapshot in time of current resource configurations. An entire snapshot of all supported resources within a region can be captured that will detail their current configurations with all related metadata.</p>
<p>Enable notifications of when a change has occurred on a resource. The Simple Notification Service, SNS, is used with AWS Config to capture a configuration stream of changes, enabling you to process and analyze the changes to resources. It can provide the information on who made the change and when, through AWS CloudTrail integration. AWS CloudTrail is used with AWS Config to help you identify who made the change and when, and with which API. You can enforce rules that check the compliancy of your resource against specific controls. Predefined and custom rules and be configured with AWS Config, allowing you to check resources’ compliance against these rules. You can perform security analysis within your AWS environment.</p>
<p>A number of security resources can be recorded and when this is coupled with rules relating to security, such as encryption checks, this can become a powerful analysis tool. And it can provide relationship connectivity information between resources. The AWS management console provides a great relationship query, allowing you to quickly see and identify which resources are related to any other resource. For example, when looking at an EBS volume, you’ll be able to see which EC2 instance it is connected to.</p>
<p>And it does all of this and presents the data in a friendly format. This is a lot of incredibly useful data that can be used across a range of different scenarios, some of which we will cover later in this course. Now unfortunately at the time we’re writing this course, the AWS Config service does not capture this information for all services. But it certainly captures data for the most common services and resources, which you would want to hold information for.</p>
<p>Services such as: EC2, RDS, IAM, and VPC. And it’s great to see that within each of these, there are specific security resources that are covered, such as security groups and custom IAM policies. This makes AWS Config very useful when it comes to carrying out a security analysis, which we will cover in a later lecture. For more information on the latest resources that AWS Config supports, please see the link on-screen.</p>
<p>AWS Config is region-specific, meaning that if you have resources in multiple regions, then you will have to configure AWS Config for each region you want to record resource changes for. When doing so, you are able to specify different options for each region. For example, you could configure Config in one region to record all supported resources across all services within that region and add a pre-defined AWS manage config rule that would check if EBS volumes are encrypted.</p>
<p>In another region, you could select to only record a specific type of resource, such as security groups, with no pre-defined rules allocated. Some of you may be wondering, what if the service you want to monitor is not region-specific, such as IAM? Well in this case, there is a separate option to include global services, which IAM falls under.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Amazon-CloudWatch"><a href="#What-is-Amazon-CloudWatch" class="headerlink" title="What is Amazon CloudWatch?"></a>What is Amazon CloudWatch?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture which will provide you with a high-level overview of what Amazon CloudWatch is and does.</p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch is a global service that has been designed to be your window into the health and operational performance of your applications and infrastructure. It’s able to collate and present meaningful operational data from your resources allowing you to monitor and review their performance. This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of the insights that CloudWatch presents, which in turn can trigger automated responses or provide you with the opportunity and time to make manual operational changes and decisions to optimize your infrastructure if required. </p>
<p>Understanding the health and performance of your environment is one of the fundamental operations you can do to help you minimize incidents, outages and errors. As a result Amazon CloudWatch is heavily used by those in an operational role and site reliability engineers. </p>
<p>There are a wide range of components to Amazon CloudWatch, making this an extremely powerful service. Let me now run through at a high level some of these features and what they allow you to do, including CloudWatch Dashboards, CloudWatch Metrics and Anomaly Detection, CloudWatch Alarms, CloudWatch EventBridge, CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Insights.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Management console, the AWS CLI, or the PutDashboard API, you can build and customize a page using different visual widgets displaying metrics and alarms relating to your resources to form a unified view. These dashboards can then be viewed from within the AWS Management Console.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the different types of widgets you can select to build your dashboard.</p>
<p>The resources within your customized dashboard can be from multiple different regions making this a very useful feature. Being able to build your own views, you can quickly and easily design and configure different dashboards to represent the data that you need to see from a business and operational perspective. For example, you might need to view all performance metrics and alarms from resources relating to a particular project, or a specific customer. Or you might want to create a different dashboard for a specific region or application deployment. The key point is that they are fully customizable to be designed how YOU want to represent your data.  </p>
<p>For more information of selecting the right chart type to visualize data, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-visualization-how-to-convey-your-data-1112/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/data-visualization-how-to-convey-your-data-1112/</a></p>
<p>Once you have built your Dashboards, you can easily share them with other users, even those who may not have access to your AWS account. This allows you to share the findings gathered by CloudWatch with those who may find the results interesting and beneficial to their day-to-day operational role, but don’t necessarily require the need to access your AWS account.</p>
<p>Metrics are a key component and fundamental to the success of Amazon CloudWatch, they enable you to monitor a specific element of an application or resource over a period of time while tracking these data points. For example, the number of DiskReads or DiskWrites on an EC2 instance, these are just 2 metrics relating to EC2 that you can monitor. Different services will offer different metrics, for example, there is no DiskReads for Amazon S3 as it’s not a compute service, and so instead metrics relevant to the service are available, such as NumberOfObjects, which tracks the number of objects in a specified bucket.</p>
<p>By default when working with Amazon CloudWatch, everyone has access to a free set of Metrics, and for EC2, these are collated over a time period of 5 minutes. However, for a small fee, you can enable detailed monitoring which will allow you to gain a deeper insight by collating data across the metrics every minute. In addition to detailed monitoring, you can also create your own custom metrics for your applications, using any time-series data points that you need, but be aware that when you create a metric they are regional, meaning that any metrics created in 1 region will not be available in another.</p>
<p>CloudWatch metrics also allow you to enable a feature known as anomaly detection. This allows CloudWatch to implement machine learning algorithms against your metric data to help detect any activity that sits outside of the normal baseline parameters that are generally expected. Advance warning of this can help you detect an issue long before it becomes a production problem.</p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch Alarms tightly integrate with Metrics that I just discussed and they allow you to implement automatic actions based on specific thresholds that you can configure relating to each metric.</p>
<p>For example, you could set an alarm to activate an auto scaling operation, such as provisioning another instance if your CPUUtilization of an EC2 instance peaked at 75% for more than 5 minutes. You could also configure an alarm to send a message to an SNS Topic when the same instance drops back below the 75% threshold, causing it to come out of an ‘alarm’ state notifying engineers of the change. </p>
<p>For more information on SNS, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-sqs-sns-ses/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-sqs-sns-ses/</a></p>
<p>Speaking of Alarm states, there are 3 different states for any alarm associated with a metric, these being OK – The metric is within the defined configured threshold, ALARM – The metric has exceeded the thresholds set, and INSUFFICIENT_DATA – The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.</p>
<p>CloudWatch alarms are also easily integrated with your dashboards as well, allowing you to quickly and easily visualize the status of each alarm. When an alarm is triggered into a state of ALARM, it will turn red on your dashboard, giving a very obvious indication.</p>
<p>CloudWatch EventBridge is a feature that has evolved from an existing feature called Amazon Events. So if you have any prior experience working with CloudWatch Events then this will be fairly familiar to you.  </p>
<p>CloudWatch EventBridge provides a means of connecting your own applications to a variety of different targets, typically AWS services, to allow you to implement a level of real-time monitoring, allowing you to respond to events that occur in your application as they happen.  </p>
<p>But what is an event? Basically, an event is anything that causes a change to your environment or application.</p>
<p>The big benefit of using CloudWatch EventBridge is that it offers you the opportunity to implement a level of event-driven architecture in a real-time decoupled environment. </p>
<p>EventBridge establishes a connection between your applications and specified targets to allow a data stream of events to be sent. Currently, there is a wide range of targets that can be used as a destination for events as you can see here.</p>
<p>For the latest list of targets, please see the relevant documentation here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-targets.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-targets.html</a></p>
<p>Let me provide a quick level overview of some of the elements of this feature, and these include Rules, Targets, and Event Buses.</p>
<p>So starting with Rules. A rule acts as a filter for incoming streams of event traffic and then routes these events to the appropriate target defined within the rule. The rule itself can route traffic to multiple targets, however the target must be in the same region. </p>
<p>Next, we have Targets. We saw a list of these just a few moments ago, so targets and where the events are sent by the Rules, such as AWS Lambda, SQS, Kinesis or SNS. All events received by the target are done os in a JSON format</p>
<p>Now finally, Event Buses. An Event Bus is the component that actually receives the Event from your applications and your rules are associated with a specific event bus. CloudWatch EventBridge uses a default Event bus that is used to receive events from AWS services, however, you are able to create your own Event Bus to capture events from your own applications. </p>
<p>CloudWatch Logs gives you a centralized location to house all of your logs from different AWS services that provide logs as an output, such as CloudTrail, EC2, VPC Flow logs, etc, in addition to your own applications.</p>
<p>When log data is fed into Cloudwatch Logs you can utilize CloudWatch Log Insights to monitor the logstream in real time and configure filters to search for specific entries and actions that you need to be alerted on or respond to. This allows CloudWatch Logs to act as a central repository for real-time monitoring of log data. </p>
<p>An added advantage of CloudWatch logs comes with the installation of the Unified CloudWatch Agent, which can collect logs and additional metric data from EC2 instances as well from on-premise services running either a Linux or Windows operating system. This metric data is in addition to the default EC2 metrics that CloudWatch automatically configures for you. The list of these additional metrics collected by the agent can be found at this link <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There are now 3 different types of insights within CloudWatch, there are Log Insights, Container Insights, and Lambda Insights.</p>
<p>But what exactly are insights? Well as the name suggests, they provide the ability to get more information from the data that CloudWatch is collecting. So let’s look at each of these at a high level to understand the role that they perform, starting with Log Insights.</p>
<p>This is a feature that can analyze your logs that are captured by CloudWatch Logs at scale in seconds using interactive queries delivering visualizations that can be represented as bar, line, pie, or stacked area charts. The versatility of this feature allows you to work with any log file formats that AWS services or your applications might be using.</p>
<p>Using a flexible approach, you can use Log insights to filter your log data to retrieve specific data allowing you to gather insights that you are interested in. Also using the visual capabilities of the feature, it can display them in a visual way.</p>
<p>Much like Log insights, Container Insights allow you to collate and group different metric data from different container services and applications within AWS, for example, the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, (EKS) and the Elastic Container Service (ECS). </p>
<p>In addition to the standard metrics collected for these services by CloudWatch, Container Insights also allows you to capture and monitor diagnostic data giving you additional insights into how to resolve issues that arise within your container architecture. This monitoring and insight data can be analyzed at the cluster, node, pod, and task level making it a valuable tool to help you understand your container applications and services.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by now, this feature provides you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of your applications using AWS Lambda. Working on the principles as we have seen with the previous 2 insight features, it gathers and aggregates system and diagnostic metrics related to AWS Lambda to help you monitor and troubleshoot your serverless applications.</p>
<p>To enable Lambda Insights, you need to enable the feature per Lambda function that you create within Monitoring Tools section of your function:</p>
<p>This ensures that a CloudWatch extension is enabled for your function allowing it to collate system-level metrics which are recorded every time the function is invoked.</p>
