<h1 id="Project-Metrics-and-KPIs"><a href="#Project-Metrics-and-KPIs" class="headerlink" title="Project Metrics and KPIs"></a>Project Metrics and KPIs</h1><p>Hello and welcome to project metrics and KPIs. When putting together a project, the goals need to be specific and measurable, and they need to be defined at the outset of the project. Establishing measurable goals means that appropriate metrics and key performance indicators, or KPIs, need to be established and agreed upon.</p>
<p>Over the next several minutes we are going to take a look at some of the more commonly used metrics and KPIs as they relate to DevOps projects. We will review metrics and KPIs that provide faster outcomes, improve efficiency, ensure quality and security, and ensure a positive culture.</p>
<p>Some metrics and KPIs that can help produce faster outcomes for many DevOps projects include deployment frequency, deployment speed, and deployment size. Deployment frequency is important because the frequency of deployments is usually a critical driver in most DevOps projects. Deployment speed is also just as important, because DevOps projects benefit when you decrease the time it takes for deployments. Deployment size refers to the number of features, stories, and bug fixes that are deployed each time. This is also a key metric to track. </p>
<p>Efficiency can be improved by increasing the server to admin ratio, which refers to the number of administrators that are required for the number of servers that are necessary. Likewise, the staff member to customers ratio should also be kept at a minimum. This metric refers to the number of staff members that are necessary to serve a specific number of customers. Application usage and performance are two other key metrics to consider when trying to improve efficiency. While application usage refers to how busy an application is, application performance refers to how well the application is running, based on application metrics.</p>
<p>There are many different metrics and KPIs that should be tracked to ensure quality and security. For example, you should keep track of how often your deployments or applications fail. This metric is referred to as deployment failure rate. Application failure rates should also be tracked so that you know how often your application is experiencing configuration failures and performance timeouts. And while we are talking about failure rates, let’s not forget about mean time to recover. You should be paying attention to mean time to recover. Because this metric indicates how quickly you are able to recover from your failures.</p>
<p>Because it’s never a good thing when your customers double as bug testers, you need to be keeping track of bug report rates as well. You should always know how many bugs your customers are finding and whether they are increasing or decreasing.</p>
<p>Last but not least, availability metrics and SLA metrics are critical as well. By tracking availability, you can see what percentage of time your application is actually available for your customers. By tracking availability, you can measure against your service level agreements.</p>
<p>To ensure a positive culture in your organization, you need to keep employee morale and retention rates in mind. While employee morale can be difficult to measure, it’s important to understand if your employees are happy with where the organization is and where it’s heading, this is because it directly affects retention rates which of course you should also be monitoring. If your organization is losing staff, you need to find out why.</p>
<p>While these metrics that we just reviewed are the most common, what you really should be doing is tracking metrics that focus on the outcomes that you are trying to achieve. These metrics and KPIs will vary from project to project, and from organization to organization.</p>

<h1 id="Mentoring-Team-Members-on-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Mentoring-Team-Members-on-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Mentoring Team Members on Agile Practices"></a>Mentoring Team Members on Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to mentoring team members on agile practices. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what it takes to mentor team members so that agile practices can be implemented successfully.</p>
<p>When an organization decides to begin the transformation to Agile, it will usually bring in one or more agile coaches or mentors. These mentors are brought in to help the organization’s teams either adopt agile methods or to improve current methods that are in place. For these coaches and mentors to be effective, they must be real agents of change. By this, I mean that they must really want to help people realize how they are currently working and spending their time. And they must be good at driving adoption of the newer agile methods that they were brought in to develop.</p>
<p>When an agile coach or mentor is brought in, what the coach will typically do is work with multiple teams to implement the new agile methods. A key role of an agile coach or mentor is to remove both internal and external roadblocks that prevent the organization from implementing agile practices. To be effective at this, the agile coach or mentor needs to be good at not just coaching and mentoring, but also at teaching and facilitating. This is because the mentor needs to serve as both a consultant and a trainer.</p>
<p>Putting agile concepts into practice requires buy-in because doing so isn’t as simple as learning the concepts through an agile training course. It takes dedication to facilitate change.</p>
<p>Agile coaches and mentors come in many different flavors. For example, some mentors may be technical experts that prefer to teach an organization’s team members how to apply specific agile concepts and practices. Such technical oriented coaches and mentors may hold peer sessions with team members.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may have agile coaches and mentors that focus more on agile processes or on the management of work activities. These types of will often demonstrate how to run standup meetings and review meetings.</p>
<p>Although bringing in external agile coaches and mentors can kickstart the process for moving to agile practices, ultimately, the team members within the organization will need to develop the ability to mentor each other. As team members become skilled at mentoring each other and at learning from one another, the move to agile practices becomes easier. For this to happen, however, teams need to work in a collaborative fashion, the work cannot be done by individuals in a vacuum.</p>

<h1 id="In-Team-and-Cross-Team-Collaboration"><a href="#In-Team-and-Cross-Team-Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration"></a>In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration</h1><p>Hello and welcome to In-Team and Cross-Team Collaboration. In this lesson, we will take a look at the ways that collaboration can be enabled in an organization.</p>
<p>To function well, Agile teams must be able to support effective collaboration. Effective collaboration will often require changes to an organization’s culture and to the ways that cross-functional teams collaborate. New collaboration tools may also need to be implemented.</p>
<p>In an effort to facilitate collaboration, many organizations, over recent years, have moved to open floor plans with very few walls. Although the intention is noble, open floor plans can, however, actually inhibit collaboration. Additionally, distractions can also often reduce productivity. It turns out that most people get more done when they are working in a quiet private environment.</p>
<p>While asynchronous communications should be encouraged, it should be understood that not all such communications are going to be treated with urgency. An organization’s employees should be able to focus on their jobs without feeling like decisions are being made without their input. Meetings that get scheduled should be scheduled with strictly enforced time frames and should follow clearly defined agendas. This means that if there is no specific agenda to discuss, there is no meeting.</p>
<p>Because of the shift to remote working and work from home, it’s also important that collaboration via communication become an accepted practice. As a matter of fact, the ability to collaborate with remote teammates should be an expected skillset. And whether or not communication is handled in person or remotely, all staff should feel comfortable communicating openly and frankly. Because there will always be disagreements and conflict within any team. It’s also important that team members enroll in some sort of mediation skills training.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the members of a specific team need to be able to collaborate effectively. However, it’s also just as critical that team members be able to collaborate with people outside of the immediate team. This is necessary because there will often be a need for people with different expertise to work together to achieve a specific goal. These people will often be from different departments or different teams within the organization.</p>
<p>Effective collaboration of cross-functional teams often results in innovation and improved results because it allows people with different areas of expertise to bring different perspectives to the same problem. This often results in alternate solutions that may not have otherwise been thought of.</p>
<p>Organizations with cross-functional teams that can collaborate well will often see fewer turf wars develop, because each team views itself as part of the solution. By recognizing and rewarding this type of team mentality, organizations can cement this feeling of team cohesion across many different cross-functional teams.</p>
<p>An important part of effective collaboration, whether it’s in-team or cross-team collaboration is tooling. To facilitate collaboration, organizations should consider tools and solutions that enable streamlined communications. Some tools that can help foster collaboration include Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams is the flagship chat and communications application from Microsoft. It offers various communication options, including chat, notes, and even meetings. It also facilitates the sharing of documents. I should also mention that Microsoft Teams makes it easy for internal communications as well as communications with external users.</p>
<p>Slack is another common collaboration tool that Agile teams often use. It offers multiple communication channels that can be organized by team, topic, or even project. The conversations that take place on Slack can be retained and can be searched. Like Microsoft Teams, Slack allows users to communicate with both internal and external teammates.</p>
<p>Google Hangouts is a tool that organizations use to facilitate collaboration and communication. It offers messaging, video, and chat. It also supports voice over IP features. Like the two other previous solutions mentioned, Google hangouts facilitates conversations among multiple users and can save chat histories online.</p>
<p>While these aren’t the only tools that can be used to facilitate in-team and cross-team collaboration, they are some of the more common ones. The most important thing to remember, however, is that to facilitate in-team and cross-team collaboration, you should implement tools that make it easier and not harder for your team members to communicate.</p>

<h1 id="Tools-and-Processes-for-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Tools-and-Processes-for-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Tools and Processes for Agile Practices"></a>Tools and Processes for Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to tools and processes for agile practices. In this lesson, we are going to touch on some of the physical tools, project management tools, and screen recording tools that you can use to facilitate agile practices in your organization.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly true that specific tools are not necessarily needed to develop using agile methods, using agile friendly tools can certainly improve your outcomes. That said, the process that you follow is really the most important tool for agile development. All of the tools that we are about to discuss are really secondary to the process itself.</p>
<p>While there are many digital tools available to facilitate your agile practices, physical tools also play a role. For example, many organizations rely on simple things, like whiteboards, when collaborating. Even sticky notes and index cards can be useful for making notes and for moving tasks around. I know it sounds old-school, but physical tools can often be more convenient and more effective under certain circumstances. So, don’t discount them.</p>
<p>Project management tools, by definition, are used to assist with project planning and execution along with monitoring. They are also helpful for managing and tracking releases. Project management tools are also used to record the outcomes of retrospectives and to work with them as well. Things like Kanban boards are often included in many different project management tools that are available.</p>
<p>Many tools will also offer visualizations and pretty graphics that measure team progress against the defined goals and targets that have been set. Other project management tools will even integrate with code repositories and CI&#x2F;CD tools.</p>
<p>Azure DevOps offers flexible Kanban boards and traceability via backlogs. It also offers customizable dashboards, scrum boards, and can even integrate with code repositories. This allows you to link code changes directly to tasks and bugs.</p>
<p>While Azure DevOps is a pretty robust project management tool for agile practices, there are some other common tools available. These tools include things like JIRA Agile, Tremolo, SprintGround, and many, many others. Your job is to determine which project management tools work best for your agile practice.</p>
<p>The last type of tools that I want to talk about here are screen recording tools. Screen recording tools are often overlooked when it comes to agile practices. However, they can actually be quite helpful, especially when there are remote team members involved. More specifically, screen recording tools like Camtasia and SnagIt, can be helpful because you can use them to record bugs in action. This allows team members to actually see what is happening. Such tools can also be used to record tutorials and demonstrations as well. That being the case, don’t discount screen recording tools when building an agile practice.</p>

<h1 id="Creating-Organizational-Structures-for-Agile-Practices"><a href="#Creating-Organizational-Structures-for-Agile-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices"></a>Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Creating Organizational Structures for Agile Practices. Anytime an organization reorganizes, things can get a little bit challenging, reorganizing to become agile is no exception. As I mentioned earlier in the course, becoming an agile organization requires a shift in culture. This means that any existing processes and even policies within the organization are going to be challenged. These reorganization pains are typically more noticeable in larger organizations, because there are often certain operating structures that are in place, as well as many rigid rules and methodologies.</p>
<p>Because businesses today are starting to recognize that their structures and processes do not lend themselves well to agile, many are now making changes. Such changes include the move from horizontal teams to vertical teams.</p>
<p>An organization that leverages a horizontal team structure will often divide its teams based on software architecture. For example, the image on your screen shows how an organization might be divided into teams that are based on user interface, service-oriented architecture and data.</p>
<p>However, a vertical team structure like the one you now see on your screen will typically align with outcomes and span across the architecture rather than mirror it.</p>
<p>Organizations will often leverage vertical teams when running agile projects because vertical teams will often result in stronger outcomes. Vertical teams also offer the flexibility of better scaling. This is because teams can be based on features rather than projects.</p>
<p>As you can see on the screen, we’ve built upon our previous vertical team structure simply by adding teams that reflect additional features and outcomes.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when creating organizational structures for agile practices, you should aim to build vertical teams rather than horizontal ones.</p>

<h1 id="Course-Conclusion"><a href="#Course-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Course Conclusion"></a>Course Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations, you’ve come to the end of Designing and Implementing an Agile Work Management Approach. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We started things off by looking at project metrics and key performance indicators, or KPIs. You learned about some of the more commonly used metrics and KPIs as they relate to DevOps projects. We reviewed metrics and KPIs that produce faster outcomes, improve efficiency, ensure quality and security, and ensure a positive workforce culture.</p>
<p>We then took a look at what goes into properly mentoring team members on Agile practices, where you learned what skills are necessary to coach and mentor on Agile practices.</p>
<p>Later on, we dove into in-team and cross-team collaboration. You learned how to achieve effective collaboration through cultural changes, cross-functional team collaboration, and tooling. </p>
<p>After learning about collaboration, you learned about tools and processes that are necessary for Agile practices. We looked at physical tools, project management tools, and even touched on-screen recording tools.</p>
<p>We wrapped up by covering the steps and requirements for creating organizational structures for Agile practices. More specifically, we compared horizontal teams versus vertical teams.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have the foundational knowledge that is required to effectively design and implement an Agile work management approach.</p>
<p>To learn more about designing and implementing an Agile work management approach, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy because we’re always publishing new ones. Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As always, thanks for watching and happy learning.</p>
