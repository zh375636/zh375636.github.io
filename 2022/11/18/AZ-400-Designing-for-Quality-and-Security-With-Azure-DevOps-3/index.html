<h1 id="Identifying-amp-Recommending-Quality-Metrics"><a href="#Identifying-amp-Recommending-Quality-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Identifying &amp; Recommending Quality Metrics"></a>Identifying &amp; Recommending Quality Metrics</h1><p>Azure DevOps allows organizations to deliver software faster and with higher quality. Oddly enough these two metrics are typically viewed as polar opposites. Generally speaking the faster an application is typically rolled out, the lower the quality of that app. The higher the quality of the app, the longer the development cycle. However, by leveraging <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps processes, developers can identify issues sooner which in turn usually means that they can fix them sooner. The list that you see on your screen shows key metrics that directly relate to the quality of the code being produced, as well as the quality of the build and deployment process. Failed builds percentage refers to the overall percentage of builds that are failing, while failed deployments percentage refers to the overall percentage of deployments that are failing. Ticket volume is the total volume of customer and bug tickets. The bug bounds percentage refers to the percentage of customer or bug tickets that are being reopened. Lastly, the unplanned work percentage refers to the percentage of the overall work being performed that’s unplanned. Taking stock of these key metrics allows you to more easily identify and recommend quality metrics in your development environment.</p>

<h1 id="Feature-Flags"><a href="#Feature-Flags" class="headerlink" title="Feature Flags"></a>Feature Flags</h1><p>Hi there, let’s talk a little bit about feature flags. Feature flags are used to change how things work. Instead of making significant changes to the actual code within an app, you only need to make a small configuration change, and more often than not, this configuration change will only be necessary for a small number of users.</p>
<p>Leveraging feature flags provides an elegant solution when you would otherwise need to deploy new code into trunk, but not yet have it functional. Feature flags are typically implemented as the value of variables which are then used to control conditional logic.</p>
<p>The best way to explain feature flags is to use an example. So let’s imagine a scenario where your team is working in the main trunk branch of an e-commerce application. Your manager has come to you and asked if it makes more sense to have the shipping cost calculations performed in the main branch instead of dealing with the messy operations of merge later on. How do you try this out without making wholesale changes to the app or, worse yet, breaking the app altogether?</p>
<p>In this case, you could use a feature flag to get around this. What you could do in this case is make a small change in your code so that users without the feature flag set continue using the original shipping calculation code while your team members who are working on the new shipping calculation code and who have the feature flag set see the new code that’s being created.</p>
<p>This scenario would be an example of how to use a business feature flag which is used to determine business logic. The other type of feature flag is known as a release flag.</p>
<p>Now to demonstrate the use of a release flag, let’s build upon our previous example. Let’s assume your team has completed its work on the shipping calculation code. While you’re pretty confident in your team’s work you might be a little bit apprehensive about pushing this new code out to all of your users at once. In this case you’d rather push out the changes to a group of users that’s better at dealing with new code and the issues that sometimes arise from that new code. This type of group consists of users that are referred to as canaries. The term canary comes from the old use of canaries in coal mines.</p>
<p>What you would do in this case is change the configuration so that your canary users also have the feature flag set. As a result they can start testing the new code as well while the original code continues to function for all other users. If things go south for the canary users you can quickly disable the flag for them so they can go back to using the original code.</p>
<p>So now that you’ve been introduced to feature flags in general, let’s talk a little bit about their life cycle. The minute you use a feature flag for the first time, that feature flag gets added to the overall technical debt that you need to contend with. That in mind you need to realize that the longer a particular flag hangs around as part of your code, the bigger that technical debt becomes.</p>
<p>As you continue to add more and more feature flags to the code, that code becomes more and more complex. Ultimately you wind up with code that’s more difficult to test than it needs to be and it’s harder to maintain due to its complexity. This often makes it more difficult to troubleshoot because it becomes harder and harder to duplicate problems as part of that troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>To avoid these types of issues, you really need to remove unneeded feature flags as soon as you can. Developing a plan for managing your feature flag life cycle helps accomplish this. As soon as a flag is added to your code you need to have a plan for when it’s going to be removed.</p>
<p>I should also point out that you should never repurpose feature flags. This is a big no-no because it opens you up to the possibility of using a flag for a new purpose even though that flag is still part of your code for its original purpose. This can cause all kinds of serious headaches.</p>
<p>To effectively manage the life cycle for your feature flags, start by making sure that you know which flags exist. You should also be keeping track of which feature flags are enabled in which environments. You should also, of course, have a plan for when your flags will be used in production and when they will be removed.</p>
<p>Implementing a feature flag management system such as this allows you to reap the benefits of those flags while keeping your technical debt to a minimum.</p>

<h1 id="Technical-Debt"><a href="#Technical-Debt" class="headerlink" title="Technical Debt"></a>Technical Debt</h1><p>Welcome to technical debt. In this lecture, we’re going to talk a little bit about what technical debt is and how to manage it.</p>
<p>Technical debt refers to the future costs that will be incurred when you decide to deploy an easy solution rather than one that’s grounded in best practices. it’s essentially the price you pay for bypassing best practices because deploying them takes longer to complete.</p>
<p>The term technical debt is used because of its similarity to financial debt. Think about it. A person who is in debt is often in debt because he often makes decisions that only consider the now. However, over time, interest accrues. As that interest accrues it gets harder and harder for that person to manage that debt in the future. Fewer and fewer options are then available to him. This snowball effect isn’t much different from the snowball effect that occurs when developers make decisions without any regard for the future. Just like financial debt, technical debt will snowball to the point where developers wind up spending most of their time troubleshooting problems and doing rework. This prevents them from adding much value to the project and to the organization in general.</p>
<p>Increased technical debt is often blamed on tight deadlines because if a developer is forced to throw together code quickly he’s often going to take shortcuts, it’s only natural. For example, a developer who is under the gun to add new features to an application might simply make a copy of a specific piece of code and then edit it rather than refactoring the original method to include the new functionality. This faster way of completing the task allows the developer to only have to test the new code. He can also avoid the more stringent testing that would probably be required if he refactored the original method because it’s going to be used by other parts of the code.</p>
<p>While this strategy does meet the deadline, it results in a longer-term problem because there are now two different copies of the same code that will need to be managed and maintained going forward. This increases the risk of the app logic diverging.</p>
<p>Other causes of technical debt include a lack of technical skills, a lack of product direction or ownership, or maybe an organization with no defined coding standards at all. Regardless, at the end of the day, technical debt is a main cause of projects that fail to meet their deadlines.</p>
<p>Because of the impact that technical debt has on delivery and maintenance of solutions, it’s critical that you integrate the assessment and measurement of technical debt and of code quality as part of your continuous integration and deployment pipelines in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps.</p>
<p>By building in support for things like Sonar Cloud to an Azure DevOps pipeline, you can leverage it to analyze your code. This allows you to drill down into issues that are identified. As a result, you can see what the issues are along with suggested remedies. You can even view estimates of the time that’s required to apply each remedy.</p>

<h1 id="Team-Structures"><a href="#Team-Structures" class="headerlink" title="Team Structures"></a>Team Structures</h1><p>Welcome to team structures. In this brief lecture, we’re going to look at the differences between horizontal teams and vertical teams. Reorganizing to be agile is often difficult for organizations. Doing so often requires a shift in culture that runs counter to many existing policies and processes that may already be in place within the organization.</p>
<p>This often occurs because governance requirements within these organizations, especially the larger ones, usually result in lots of rigid rules and operating structures. Delegation of authority is usually very narrow as well because most large organizations haven’t yet moved to an agile structure they often have difficulty coping with change. To avoid being disrupted by startups, established organizations must rethink their team structures.</p>
<p>More traditional horizontal team structures split teams up according to the software architecture. For example, an organization’s teams might be organized into user interface, service-oriented architecture, and data. By contrast, this same organization could also be broken up into a vertical team structure. This vertical structure could span the architecture and it could be aligned with product outcomes instead. Generally speaking, a vertical team structure such as the one you see in this example often results in better outcomes in agile projects. In such a structure it’s critical that each project have a clearly identified owner. The vertical team structure also allows for easier scaling. This is made possible because to scale, all an organization needs to do is add teams. In this example you see on your screen additional feature teams have been created to scale out. The key takeaway here is that vertical teams are often a better strategy versus horizontal teams when trying to become agile.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Testing"><a href="#Performance-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Performance Testing"></a>Performance Testing</h1><p>Hi there, welcome to performance testing. Over the next few minutes we’re going to look at some strategies for planning and implementing performance testing. Because users are sensitive to slow or malfunctioning applications, organizations need to ensure that they are incorporating performance testing and load testing procedures as part of the building and deployment of applications.</p>
<p>While quick deployment of applications and solutions is important, what’s even more important is the ability to deliver well-designed and while performing solutions that provide value to the end-users and to the organization.</p>
<p>Before talking about performance testing, it’s important to understand the difference between performance testing and load testing. This is because performance testing is often confused with load testing but these are really two different concepts. Performance testing is used to see how responsive an application is, how stable it is, and how efficiently it uses the resources that are assigned to it. While load testing is used to test an application’s performance when it’s run under a load.</p>
<p>While it’s expected that an organization’s testing team should focus on features when designing a solution, it should also be noted that performance is in many ways a feature itself.</p>
<p>A common issue that organizations often run into is that more often than not performance testing only enters the equation after the development team is comfortable with the stability of the code. However, what should be happening is that the organization’s performance testers should start running new code as soon as it’s available. What this does is ensure feedback makes its way back to the developers sooner rather than later. This allows the developers to more quickly rectify issues.</p>
<p>During performance testing you should be looking at how long user actions take to complete within an application. You should also be working out how much load the solution can handle before things start going south. This might require you to identify where the bottlenecks are as the number of users increases or as the size of the data grows. You may also want to ensure that the application or solution can run for long periods of time without issues like memory leaks which can cause performance degradation.</p>
<p>That all being said it’s important to utilize automated testing tools to perform this testing because it’s impractical to perform any sort of meaningful performance testing or to integrate within a DevOps pipeline without a suite of automation tools.</p>
<p>Simply compiling a list of tools that you plan to use in your performance testing activities is not a plan. I mean sure it’s a good idea but there’s more involved. You need to also sort out how you’re going to configure your testing environment and what testing processes you’re going to use. You’ll also need to define success and failure. What will success look like? What will failure look like?</p>
<p>There are also several questions that you need to answer. You’ll need to understand the expectations of the business and the expectations of the target users. When creating a performance testing plan you’ll also need to define the metrics that you plan to measure.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s critical that performance testing be included in your planning right from the start. If you’ll be using a Kanban board it might be a good idea to have a space near it that can be used to plan out your testing strategy. Any gaps in your testing strategy should be highlighted during iteration planning and you should also sort out how you plan to monitor performance once a solution has been deployed.</p>

<h1 id="Inspecting-amp-Validating-Code-Base-for-Compliance"><a href="#Inspecting-amp-Validating-Code-Base-for-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Inspecting &amp; Validating Code Base for Compliance"></a>Inspecting &amp; Validating Code Base for Compliance</h1><p>Hi there, welcome back. In this lecture, we’re going to dive into inspection and validation of code base for compliance. Despite the importance of data security. with every new day, it seems a new story about another data breach pops up. Whether it’s credit card data being stolen, website logins being hacked, or other personal data that’s stolen it’s a problem.</p>
<p>So what’s happening?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that organizations need to protect information from people that shouldn’t have access to it, however, they also need to make sure that customer information isn’t altered or destroyed when it shouldn’t be. On the flipside, organizations also need to ensure that data is destroyed when it’s supposed to be. Users need to be properly authenticated before getting access to data and those users need to have the proper permissions to do so. Using historical data archive data and logs should allow organizations to track down evidence when something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Building secure applications is a big part of security however it can be difficult to do this. While you may find it surprising many developers and other IT professionals assume that they understand security. In reality, they really don’t. This is because the entire cyber security discipline is always evolving, which is not unlike any other IT discipline. That being the case ongoing education and training is critical.</p>
<p>When developing secure applications it’s important that you ensure that the code is created correctly and that it securely implements any features that are required. On top of that you need to ensure that the features themselves are designed with security in mind. This doesn’t always happen.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to make sure that when you’re developing an application that the application is compliant with any special rules or regulations that it needs to comply with. It’s important to test for this compliance during the build process and to retest periodically after deployment. This is because it’s often rather difficult to shoehorn security into an application after the fact.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, it’s important to recognize that secure development needs to be a part of every stage of the software development lifecycle. It’s even more critical for applications that process sensitive or highly confidential information.</p>
<p>With the introduction of DevOps practices, it’s now much easier for developers to integrate security testing into the app development pipeline. What this does is create an environment where security testing is part of the day-to-day delivery process rather than something that needs to be performed by security specialists after the fact.</p>

<h1 id="Inspecting-amp-Validating-Infrastructure-for-Compliance"><a href="#Inspecting-amp-Validating-Infrastructure-for-Compliance" class="headerlink" title="Inspecting &amp; Validating Infrastructure for Compliance"></a>Inspecting &amp; Validating Infrastructure for Compliance</h1><p>Hi there, welcome back. In this lecture, we’re going to look at strategies for inspecting and validating your infrastructure for compliance. More specifically we’ll take a look at PowerShell desired state configuration, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> Automation State Configuration, and InSpec.</p>
<p>Some time ago automating the creation of resources was done largely through procedural code that was written in languages like PowerShell. While this methodology does work, it doesn’t make it easy for developers to write idempotent code which is code that produces the same outcome no matter how many times you run it.</p>
<p>When PowerShell desired state configuration became available it was a huge improvement. Using DSC you could define a desired outcome instead of creating the process for achieving that outcome. DSC was a declarative way to automate the configuration and compliance of resources rather than a procedural way.</p>
<p>There are now several tools available that allow you to define infrastructure as code. These tools provide lots of benefits to DevOps teams because the tools allow those DevOps teams to now build reliable environments on demand and in a repeatable way. Such environments can even include operating systems and services. Teams can run the same code over and over again to ensure that the target state is not only present to begin with but to also remove any drift from that desired state.</p>
<p>Now all that being said in addition to configuration of environments there is also a need to validate those environments.</p>
<p>Azure Automation State Configuration is a validation tool that builds on PowerShell DSC. It makes management easier by allowing you to author and manage DSC configurations and to import DSC resources. You can also use Azure Automation State Configuration to generate DSC node configurations or MOF documents. These DSC configurations and MOF documents are then placed on an automation server. Target nodes which can be located in the cloud or on-prem can retrieve them from the automation server. The target nodes will then automatically conform to the desired state and report their compliance state back to that automation server.</p>
<p>InSpec is another validation tool. It’s an open-source testing framework for infrastructure. It features a language for specifying compliance, security, and other policy requirements. InSpec compares the current state of a system with the desired state that you define within the InSpec code. The tool will then go out and identify violations, displaying its findings in a report.</p>
<p>However, unlike Azure Automation State Configuration, remediations of issues identified by InSpec is performed by the administrator.</p>

<h1 id="Secure-Development-amp-Coding"><a href="#Secure-Development-amp-Coding" class="headerlink" title="Secure Development &amp; Coding"></a>Secure Development &amp; Coding</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Secure Development and Coding. Secure development starts with secure coding practices. The Open Web Application Security Project, otherwise known as OWASP, is a global organization that focuses on improving the security of software. The stated mission of OWASP is to raise the visibility of software security, so that users can make informed decisions. As a charitable organization, OWASP provides impartial advice that is practical.</p>
<p>OWASP regularly publishes its set of Secure Coding Practices, which provides guidelines that govern things like Input Validation, Output Encoding, and Authentication and Password Management. Other areas covered by these guidelines include Session Management, Access Control, and Cryptographic Practices, among others.</p>
<p>OWASP also publishes an intentionally vulnerable web application that can be used to learn about common vulnerabilities. It’s called The Juice Shop Tool Project and it includes all kinds of vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 103.</p>
<p>To learn more about the OWASP Foundation, visit the URL that you see on your screen. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://owasp.org/">http://owasp.org</a>. You can also download the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide from their website as well.</p>

<h1 id="Infrastructure-Security-Validation-Tools-amp-Practices"><a href="#Infrastructure-Security-Validation-Tools-amp-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Infrastructure Security Validation Tools &amp; Practices"></a>Infrastructure Security Validation Tools &amp; Practices</h1><p>Hi there, welcome to infrastructure security validation tools and practices. When it comes to checking for vulnerabilities you can’t just validate your applications. You need to also validate your infrastructure to check for vulnerabilities especially when you’re leveraging public cloud resources like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a>. You need to ensure that anything you deploy in these types of public cloud environments is deployed securely.</p>
<p>A robust strategy for performing infrastructure security validation requires a full suite of tools and practices. Azure tools that you can use to prevent and report on vulnerabilities include things like Security Center and Azure policies. However, you should also set up a scanner as part of your network pipeline that checks public endpoints and ports and ensures that they’ve been added to an allow list or a whitelist. If the scanner finds an endpoint or port that hasn’t been whitelisted the scanner should raise an infrastructure issue or create a bug.</p>
<p>More specifically after your scan’s complete, your Azure pipelines release should be updated with a report that shows the results of these scans. Bugs should then be created in the team’s backlog so they can be addressed.</p>
<p>By building a scanner into your pipeline, vulnerabilities are recorded as bugs. These bugs provide actionable work which you can then track and measure.</p>
<p>Now even if you build in continuous security validation in this manner and you’re running scans and checks against every change to ensure known vulnerabilities aren’t being introduced, newer vulnerabilities are always being discovered because the bad guys are always changing their strategies. This is where monitoring can help. A solid monitoring tool helps you detect, prevent, and remediate issues that are discovered while your applications running in production. Microsoft Azure offers several tools that provide detection, prevention, and alerting, based on rules like the OWASP top ten.</p>
<p>The best way to effectively minimize security vulnerabilities is to take a holistic and layered approach to security. This means that you need to secure the infrastructure and the application architecture. You also need to perform continuous validation and monitoring.</p>
<p>Following DevSecOps practices and standards allows your team to incorporate all the necessary security capabilities into the entire lifecycle of your organization’s applications. Performing continuous security validation by incorporating these practices and standards into your CI CD pipeline, allow you to ensure that your applications remain secure.</p>
