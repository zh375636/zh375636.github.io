Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a great first step for anyone looking to grow within their current career, or transition to a new career entirely.</p>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide a high-level introduction to the fundamentals of cloud computing as well as to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key cloud concepts such as scalability, elasticity, and security;</li>
<li>Cloud deployment models such as public, private, and hybrid; and</li>
<li>Cloud service models including Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also look at some common use cases and business benefits of cloud computing, and provide a framework for deciding if moving to the cloud is right for your organization.</p>
<p>Together, these objectives cover the first of four domains in the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam blueprint: Cloud Concepts, which accounts for 26% of the exam content. The other courses in this learning path will cover the remaining three domains and ensure that you are fully prepared to sit this exam.</p>
<p>This course is designed for anyone who is new to cloud computing, so no prior experience with AWS is necessary. While it may be helpful to have a basic understanding of AWS and its services, as well as some exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and operations, this is not required as all of the concepts we will introduce in this course will be explained and reinforced from the ground up.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Cloud-Computing"><a href="#What-is-Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="What is Cloud Computing?"></a>What is Cloud Computing?</h1><p>The phrase cloud computing has been used heavily within the IT industry for many years now, and more recently it’s being used within other sectors such as retail and finance, as it becomes increasingly popular. Many people often refer to the technology simply as the Cloud. Cloud computing is a rapidly growing technology, and the adoption of this is a key strategy for many organizations, and there is a very good reason behind this. It’s changing the landscape of how many companies operate on a huge scale, with significant business and technical advantages and benefits that can’t be ignored. The growth of cloud computing has been exponential over the past few years, so what is it? Put simply, cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources offering to compute, storage, database and network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale. Now there may be a couple of terms within this definition that are new to you, or not too clear, such as virtual or computer. Don’t worry, I’m going to break these down over the next couple of slides, after which I shall give you the definition again, and you should be able to fully understand this concept. </p>
<p>Before fully understanding cloud computing, we must be aware of some existing technology that it’s based upon, that being, virtualization, and this is being used in on-premise data centers for a long time. But this virtualization maximizes the power of cloud computing, and without this virtualization, it would just not be possible. So what is virtualization? In essence, it allows the possibility of having multiple virtual machines, VM’s, each running essentially a separate operating system and applications, all installed on one physical server. These VM’s all run at the same time without being aware of each other’s existence while sharing the underlying hardware resources. This sharing of hardware resources is a key element of understanding of virtualization and is achieved through a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a piece of software you use to create the virtualized environment, allowing for multiple VM’s to be installed on the same host. When installed, the hypervisor sits logically between the physical server hardware and the virtual machines and creates a shared pool of virtual hardware resources for each of them to access. All VM’s installed on the host see the hardware as they normally would. </p>
<p>However, any request to the hardware goes via the hypervisor, which then handles that access ensuring the hardware resources are shared between all other VM’s as needed and as configured. Now there are obvious benefits of virtualization, which include, reduced capital expenditure. As less hardware is required, as you have the ability to provision multiple VM’s on a single host. Reduced operating cost, because as there is less hardware, there is less space, power, cooling required within your data center, and the footprint also reduces within your data center as less space is required to house your server hardware. This optimization of resources when in a cloud environment means everyone can benefit from virtualization, from the cloud vendor to the consumer. Now just a quick note before we leave this topic of virtualization. A VM within the public cloud is sometimes referred to as an instance, this term is very vendor specific but it refers to the same object as a virtual machine. When discussing resources within cloud computing, it won’t be long before you come across the terms such as compute, storage, database and network resources. Increasingly you may also hear other terms such as machine learning or artificial intelligence. However, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">this beginners course</a>, I just want to keep the focus on the core foundation services. </p>
<p>It’s a good idea to have a clear distinction between compute, storage, database, and network. And what each of these refers to, is that it will certainly help you going forward when identifying what services you want to move to the cloud, should you decide to do so. Compute objects provide the brains to process your workload. Including what’s required to process a run request from applications and services. As a comparison, if you think of hardware devices with CPU’s and RAM, typically servers and how they work in a classic, on-premises environment, compute resources in a cloud, are comparable to these. Storage resources simply allow you to save and store your data. Any resource that allows you to save your data in the cloud, is classed as a storage resource. Again as a comparison, in the typical environment these will be seen as your server hard disks, or your network-attached storage, which provides file-level shed storage over the network, or your high-speed storage area network, your SAN, which is block-level storage accessed over a high-speed network. Database resources allow you to store structured sets of data used by your applications. Again as a comparison, databases are widely used in Data Centers with some common database engine types being SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL. Within the Cloud, there are a wide variety of database engines available for different use cases. Network resources provide the connectivity allowing all other resources, compute, storage, and database, to communicate with each other. In a typical environment, you would find hardware, such as routers to route traffic between network switches, which provide the backbone of network connectivity allowing the host to talk to one another and firewalls to allow or deny traffic into the environment. </p>
<p>So now if we go back to our definition of cloud computing given earlier of, cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources, offering to compute, storage, database and network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale. You should now have a clearer understanding of what this actually means. The red section refers back to the virtualization and the blue section refers to the typical resource types available within cloud computing that we just discussed. That has now brought me to the end of this lecture, coming up next, I shall be discussing the different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/cloud-deployment-models/">cloud deployment models</a> that are typically referred to in cloud computing.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Deployment-Models"><a href="#Cloud-Deployment-Models" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Deployment Models"></a>Cloud Deployment Models</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I shall explain some of the different deployment models used when adopting Cloud technology. Typically within Cloud computing, there are three different Cloud model types, each offering different levels of management, flexibility, security and resilience, and these are Public, Private and hybrid. Let’s start with the Public Cloud. A Public Cloud model is where a vendor makes available use of shared infrastructure including, but not limited to, compute, storage, database and network resources, that can be provisioned on demand and typically accessed over the internet for Public usage. The consumer will never see the hardware used nor know the exact physical location of their data, but they will be able to specify the geographic region in which it resides to aid with data latency depending on where you end users are located. It makes sense from a design perspective to host your infrastructure as close to the geographical region as your customers or end users are, as this will provide the best overall performance for them. All back and maintenance of the physical location services such as power calling et cetera, along with the physical maintenance of hosts such as hardware failures, will be maintained by the Cloud vendor and seemingly invisible to the end user. As a general rule, you can access your services on the Public Cloud from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection. </p>
<p>A Private Cloud is different to a Public Cloud in that the infrastructure is Privately hosted, managed, and owned by the individual company using it, giving greater and more direct control of it’s data. Enterprises who wish to keep a tighter grasp of security control may adopt this architecture. As a result, the hardware is usually held on premise. How this differs from a typical on-premise server farm approach, is that the same Cloud principals are applied to the design such as the use of virtualization, creating a pool of shared computer storage and network resources, making use of scalability and on-demand provision. With this approach, more capital expenditure is requited to acquire the host and the data center that they will physically reside in. Not only this, additional resource will be needed for the day to day operations and maintenance of this equipment. And so your daily operational cost will also increase. compared to that of a Public Cloud model. As you may have already guessed, a hybrid Cloud is a model that makes use of both Public and Private Clouds. This model may be used for seasonal burst traffic or for Disaster Recovery. A hybrid model is established when a network link is configured between the Private Cloud to services within the Public Cloud, essentially extending the logical internal network of the Private Cloud. </p>
<p>This makes the benefits given from both the Public and Private models and allows you to architect your services in the most appropriate model. However, be aware that they also contain the same negatives from both solutions too. Hybrid Clouds are normally short-term configurations, maybe for test and dev purposes, and can often be a transitional state for enterprises before moving a service to reside purely in the Public Cloud. This table highlights some of the differences between the Cloud types. So feel free to pause the video just to examine the contents of this table just so you really understand the differences. That brings me to the end of this lecture covering the three main deployment types of Cloud technology. For the remainder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">this course</a>, I’ll be primarily focusing on Public Cloud deployments. Coming up in the next lecture, I’ll be looking at some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/key-cloud-concepts/">key Cloud concepts</a> to be aware of.</p>
<h1 id="Key-Cloud-Concepts"><a href="#Key-Cloud-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Key Cloud Concepts"></a>Key Cloud Concepts</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture aimed at providing you with an understanding of some of the concepts which make cloud technology so important. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">Cloud computing</a> has a number of key characteristics that allow it to be the powerful service that is it today, and it’s a good idea to have an understanding and awareness of these and what they offer. On-demand resourcing. This essentially means that when you want to provision a resource within the cloud, it’s almost immediately available to you to allocate where and when you need it. No more waiting around for hardware to be ordered, installed, cabled, and configured before using it. Scalability. Cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment’s resources both up and down and in and out, depending on your requirements and demands of your application and services. When scaling up and down, you effectively alter the power and performance of an instance, perhaps using one with a greater CPU or memory power. When scaling in and out, you are simply adding or removing the number of instances you’re using to your fleet of compute resources. This offers a significant advantage compared to on-premise solutions, from a cost-perspective alone. Economy of scale. Due to the huge scale of resources public cloud offerings provide, which are optimized and shared between different organizations, thanks to virtualization technology, you as the end user benefit from exceptionally low resource costs compared to traditional hosting. Flexibility and elasticity. Cloud computing offers huge flexibility and elasticity to your design approach. You can choose to have as many or as few resources as you require. You decide how much and how long you want it for, and at what scale. </p>
<p>The amount of choice you have allows you to fully customize exactly how you want and need your environment, using only the resources required. Growth. Cloud computing offers your organization the ability to grow using a wide range of resources and services. Couple with the on-demand element, and your growth constraints are significantly reduced compared to a classic on-premises environment. This growth also includes the ability to reach global customers with ease, by provisioning resources across the cloud vendor’s global network. Utility-based metering. With many cloud services, you only pay for what you use. What do I mean by this? If you only have an instance running for two hours, and then shut it down, then you only pay for two hours worth of compute resources, and that’s it. Think of it like this. In your house, you only pay for your electricity when you use it, and to help keep costs down, you turn off the lights when you’re not using them. So it’s the same billing process for many resources and services. You only pay for resources when you are using them. Shared infrastructure. As discussed previously, during the virtualization section, hosts within the cloud are virtualized. As a result, multiple tenants can be running instances on the same piece of hardware. This significantly reduces the amount of physical hardware required, which in turn reduces the amount of power, cooling, and space required in the data center. And in turn, helps with the economy of scale, all resulting in cheaper costs to you as the customer. Highly available. By design, many of the core services within the public cloud and its underlying infrastructure are replicated across different geographic zones and regions. Having data copied to multiple different places automatically, helps you to ensure the durability and availability of your data and services, without even having to configure and architect for this resilience. It’s provided by the vendor as a part of their service. Security. </p>
<p>This is one of the most discussed topics within cloud computing, and many enterprises still have concerns over how secure it is. However, public cloud vendors such as AWS and Microsoft Azure are considered to be more secure than your own data center. This is down to the fact that they have to adhere to global compliance programs across multiple industries and by applying the shared responsibility model. The vendor will operate to an exceptionally high standard of security for the underlying infrastructure of the cloud, and it’s down to you, the end user, to then architect security in the cloud, using the tools, services and applications available. For more information on the shared responsibility model for Amazon Web Services, please take a look at our existing blog here. These are just some of the key characteristics of cloud computing, and you can see how differently it operates from your traditional on-premise data center deployments that you may be using today. That now brings me to the end of this lecture. Next I’ll be looking at the different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/cloud-service-models/">cloud service models</a> available.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Service-Models"><a href="#Cloud-Service-Models" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Service Models"></a>Cloud Service Models</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture, whilst you’ll be looking at some of the different cloud service models that you will likely encounter as you become more familiar with cloud computing. So now you have an idea of the different cloud types that there are, public, private, and hybrid. You will need to know which service model you would like to deploy within it. There are many different service models available, and more being defined all the time, although three of the most common are that of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. Each service offering provides a different level of manageability and customization over your solution. So let’s look at the lowest level of customization first, that being software as a service. You would have used many examples of software as a service applications, perhaps without even realizing it. Software as a service allows for the delivery of an application that can be widely distributed and accessed. An example of this would be Google’s email service, Gmail. This email-based application is fully managed by Google and is accessed over the internet, and there are no requirements to install any software on your local device to be able to use it. They are usually simple in their design, focusing on the ease of use to appeal to the wider audience. </p>
<p>From the user perspective, this offers the least amount of customization to the application itself. Platform as a service. This service offering gives a greater level of management and control to you, as you have access to an application framework that sits on top of the operating system and up. The underlying architecture, the host hardware, network components, and operating system are typically managed by the vendor and taken care of from a maintenance and support perspective, which makes this a great deployment service for developers. Developers are then free to focus and concentrate on developing great new apps sitting on top of the platform. Infrastructure as a service. This provides the highest level of customization and management. This service allows you to architect your own portion of the cloud by configuring a virtual network, which is segmented from other networks, allowing you to deploy any resources you require. In addition to this, you have the ability to configure instances from the operating system and up, including the type of operating system you install. This service offers the highest level of customization. </p>
<p>However, the underlying host is still managed by the vendor for maintenance and security purposes. There are a number of other service models, such as disaster recovery as a service, communications as a service, and monitoring as a service. For the purpose of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">this course</a>, we do not need to delve into these. However, I wanted you to be aware that there are more of these services that are making their way into the industry. For now, though, as this is an introduction, you simply need to focus and be aware of software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service, as these are the most common within the industry. That has brought me to the end of this lecture. Coming up next, I shall be explaining some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/common-use-cases-of-cloud-computing/">common use cases of cloud computing</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Common-use-cases-of-Cloud-Computing"><a href="#Common-use-cases-of-Cloud-Computing" class="headerlink" title="Common use cases of Cloud Computing"></a>Common use cases of Cloud Computing</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture. Looking at some of the use cases of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">cloud computing</a>, and how enterprises have adopted this technology. Following the cloud concept section discussed previously you may already be thinking of some of your own uses that you could use a public cloud for. However, in this lecture I just want to cover some of the common use cases of why organizations implement cloud computing. I want to start by touching one of the bigger use cases where people migrate production services from their existing on-premise solutions into the cloud. We have discussed the benefits of the cloud, and so with all those in mind many businesses are choosing to do just that. Migrate their existing production services to the public cloud. Some companies even have all of their infrastructure within the cloud. Traffic Bursting. As an example you may experience times within the year perhaps for predicted seasonal circumstances where your infrastructure takes a heavier load impact than that of other times of the year. Perhaps you are in the retail business, and over the Christmas holiday period demand increases on your infrastructure significantly. </p>
<p>In a classic data center environment you would need to provision your compute storage database, and network capacity to reflect this additional traffic, and have it take up additional space, power, and cooling all of the time. This is not an effective method of scaling not only this, but there will be additional costs for this extra infrastructure to obtain, maintain and operate, and you may only use it for a couple of months of the year. A far better method of handling this peak traffic road will be to look at cloud computing. The public cloud can be used to scale your networking resources to manage, and handle this additional traffic over your peak season. When the traffic has reduced you can then terminate your infrastructure within this cloud and stop paying for it. Remember you only pay for what you use when you use it. Backup and Disaster Recovery. </p>
<p>Due to the public clouds built-in resiliency, and durability, this makes way for a great solution for your backup requirements. To a degree you have access to unlimited storage space with built-in data management lifecycle policies allowing you to make use of even cheaper storage. For example, using Amazon Web Services S3 service, you can implement a policy to archive any data that is over 30 days old to another service called AWS Glacier which is a cold storage service with an even lower storage cost. The data is still available to you for as long as you have access to the Internet. These storage services are often replicated by the vendor to ensure its durability. Couple that with a very low cost of storage, and you can see why more and more enterprises are adopting cloud computing for this very reason. Web Hosting. Many organizations choose to host their web services on the cloud due to its ability to load balance across multiple instances as well as scale up and down quickly and automatically as traffic increases and decreases with demand. The ability to provision, and implement automatic scaling simplifies the whole process and takes out much of the administrative input, and maintenance required. Not only can your web application, and database service be enhanced by design, but they can also make use of other services such as a content delivery network a CDN, and Domain Name Services DNS. </p>
<p>Remember earlier when we were talking about selecting a geographic region for your instance depending on where end-users are. Well, what if you had end-users all over the world? A CDN is a set of systems which redirects traffic to the closest caching server which can deliver the content much faster. As a result a CDN can reduce the latency of a website for users across the globe if there are sufficient caching servers in place. DNS services can help to manage demand on your web servers by redirecting any requests to a load balancer first. This load balancer can then evenly distribute the requests to multiple web instances that you may have, therefore, reducing demand on a particular web server. Test and Development Environments. Similarly to our first point of traffic bursting, you may not have the capacity to hosting lots of servers, and storage in your data center for tests, and development purposes and from a financial perspective this would be a huge expense. Using the public cloud allows you to spin up instances as and when you need them, and then shut them down when finished. This also allows you to provision the size, and capacity of your compute resources say, for example, if you need a high-end powerful instance for your testing for an hour you can have it. </p>
<p>It would not be financially viable for you to have this wide range of compute resource within your own data center. Proof of Concept. The cloud easily allows you to implement a proof of concept design and ideas to help bring them to life at a fraction of the cost for the reasons that I’ve already covered in the previous points. This includes hosting costs and only paying for what you use. The results of your proof-of-concept can help you to build a successful business case when presenting to senior management. Big Data and Data Manipulation. The cloud also makes it easier, and cheaper to manage big data. Maintaining and implementing compute resources to handle huge data sets can be expensive and complicated. By using cloud computing resources you have the ability to use only the resources you need to analyze data when you need it. Some public cloud vendors offer specialized managed Big Data services. Which gives you a managed resource infrastructure, and framework to run your workloads on, in addition to allowing for scalability, scheduling, monitoring et cetera. Having some of these elements managed by the vendor allows you to focus on the data, and processing and not worry about the maintenance, or the underlying architecture. There are many many more use cases of services within the cloud computing space, and you’ll more than likely have a few ideas, or requirements of your own. Whatever you choose to do you will have the benefits of the concepts discussed earlier at your disposal. That now brings me to the end of this lecture. Coming up next I shall look at the comparisons between <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/data-center-architecture-cloud/">Data Center Architecture</a> and that of the cloud.</p>
<h1 id="How-Data-Center-architecture-is-reflected-in-the-Cloud"><a href="#How-Data-Center-architecture-is-reflected-in-the-Cloud" class="headerlink" title="How Data Center architecture is reflected in the Cloud"></a>How Data Center architecture is reflected in the Cloud</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture. Where I want to explain how certain technology that we are used to on premises such as routers and switches are reflected within the public cloud. You may be new to cloud computing, but you may have the experience of architecture from a classic on premise solution within a datacenter. This lecture assumes you have the knowledge of what an on premise datacenter is and how they operate. And during this lecture will make comparisons between those datacenters and how cloud computing operates. The datacenter as a whole and its architecture can be logically broken down as follows. Location. where it’s geographically located. Physical Security, both External and Internal. Mechanical and Electrical Infrastructure such as Computer Room Air conditioning units, generators, UPS and fire suppression. Network Infrastructure. Including Switches, Routers and Firewalls. Servers. Such as Application Director and Database servers. Storage. For example, your NAS, SAN Block Storage and Backup. Let’s Look at each of these in turn and discuss starting with Location. Depending on the size of your enterprise, you may only have one office and as a result, you house all of your infrastructure on site. However, many of you probably have multiple datacenters to help with resilience and availability. Public cloud providers do the same. They will have regions all over the globe. And with each of these regions, they will have at least two datacenters. These datacenters will be in a different geographic location within that region. </p>
<p>But close enough to provide high speed interconnectivity between them for data transfer in addition to assisting with high availability and resilience. Physical Security. As we have already discovered, the Public cloud is operated, managed and maintained by the vendor. As a result, the end user has no access to the physical datacenter where the resources are located. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure it is implementing and achieving the correct certification and governance regarding security. Public cloud vendors adhere to the most stringent of security controls, and for audit purposes, you can access our accreditation and compliance certifications online if required to do so. I’ve included links to two of the leading public cloud vendors, where you can find more information about their security and compliance:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview</a></p>
<p>Mechanical and Electrical. Mechanical and Electrical Infrastructure such as generators, UPS systems, Computer Room Air conditioning units for cooling, Fire suppression et cetera is situated at the datacenter itself. As a result, the same rule applies. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure they are implementing the correct capacity, resiliency and testing to ensure availability and uptime of their infrastructure. So again, this burden is removed from the end user. Where roles and responsibilities begin to change between vendor and the customer is from this point onwards. Network Infrastructure. Network Infrastructure can be quite an extensive list of equipment. However, I’m going to cover some of the more common components and how they sit within the public cloud. Networking operates at software level, there are no options to install a switch or router. How this is achieved is beyond the scope of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/introduction-8/">this course</a>. </p>
<p>But what is important is this, to a degree, you are able to implement controls, services and configurations to simulate the same effects within your infrastructure that these devices provide. There are options to create a virtual network, which can be segmented into different IP address ranges allowing you to deploy compute storage and other network resources as you require. These virtual networks are usually simple to set up requiring just a few small details before it’s created. Within AWS, these are classed as Virtual Private Clouds VPCs whereas Microsoft Azure refers to these networks as an Azure Virtual Network VNet. From here you can create different network segments both public facing and private. Routing and Access Control List for security can also be configured dynamically for enhanced control and once you have created your logical virtual network, and of course different geographic regions If desired you can then provision your instances within these different subnets. So networking components such as switches, routers and even firewalls have been replaced with virtual networks and their configurable components. </p>
<p>The backend element of how these services work is again maintained and managed by the vendor. But architecting how your virtual network is created is your responsibility and your responsibility to ensure it secure and not let vulnerable to attacks. Servers. Depending on your vendor, servers are typically referred to as instances or virtual machines VMs. But as there are different servers within the typical datacenter, vendors provide different services to affect them in the cloud. For example, providers offer servers that are specific to hosting databases, and others focused on heavy processing power that is needed to process big data. This is part of the benefit of the cloud. The vendors are capable of replicating the functions that you use with your in house datacenter but with a lot more advantages. Storage. Storage is fantastic within the Cloud as it’s often regarded as unlimited, hugely scalable and highly durable. As with compute power, there are different storage services depending on what sort of data you’re using and where you intend to use it. Within your datacenter environment, you may have access to a Storage Area Network a SAN. </p>
<p>Public cloud providers can also provide block level storage too by their services. AWS offers the Elastic Block Store EBS service. Which offers persistent block level storage, and can we detach from one instance and re-attached to another instance again all configured and deployed within a few clicks. There are other great storage services within the public cloud that cater for file level storage and object storage too. And between the leading public cloud vendors, AWS and Azure, they host a myriad of storage services to cater to different solutions. For more information on these storage services, please see the following links.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/">https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/</a></p>
<p>Now I’ve only skimmed the surface of the available services and offer within the public cloud. And there are many other great services that offer amazing solutions to requirements. Many organizations have within those ideas date. However, I just wanted to point out how your current datacenter solutions and elements easily translate into the public count environment. Was at the same time carrying significant advantages and benefits as discussed earlier in this course. In the next and final lecture, I shall be providing a high-level <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/what-is-cloud-computing-introductory/summary/">summary</a> of the key points taken throughout this course.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Cloud-right-for-you"><a href="#Is-the-Cloud-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Is the Cloud right for you?"></a>Is the Cloud right for you?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture. Here we’ll begin looking at what the cloud offers organizations that typical on-premise solutions do not. Understanding this can help you decide if moving to the cloud is right for your business, so let’s get started.</p>
<p>Before making this decision, you need to ask yourself where is the business going, what are you trying to achieve, and what your business objectives? If you have answers for these questions, then you have an end goal. This is the first step in understanding if the cloud can provide you with the correct business strategy.</p>
<p>If you don’t have answers to these questions, then now would be a good time to consider them. Without knowing what your goals and priorities for your business are, it would be difficult to really understand if cloud adoption would be a viable direction to go.</p>
<p>To identify these start by focusing on your key drivers for improvement, either strategic or financial or customer-focused that may relate to specific governance controls. Understanding where your organization lacks in development, where challenges exist, which could do with re-evaluation. These factors may be infrastructure-driven or even business process-related, but it’s important to know where your weaknesses lie and where you need to streamline additional business functionality. Be sure to identify what challenges you face as an organization. Every business will have challenges, so identify what these are and try to define what you need to achieve to overcome them.</p>
<p>Once you have performance assessment, you have a much clearer mindset and be in a far greater position to understand if the cloud could aid your business and help drive it forward.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s say you now have your goals, targets, and key achievements identified. The question is can all of these be achieved by utilizing cloud computing? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>So why would you migrate to the cloud? What will it bring to the business? Let’s try and answer these questions.</p>
<p>There are so many advantages to cloud computing, which is why it’s such a hugely growing technology. To start with I want to take some time to talk about some of the characteristics of the cloud to clarify some points. As we go through, make note of any that can be useful in achieving your end goals and be of benefit to your organization. To be honest, all of them sound appealing. I did cover this at a high level in a previous course, What Is Cloud Computing, but in this course I’m going to expand on each of these and explain in greater detail the benefit from a business perspective. Let’s start with on-demand resourcing.</p>
<p>On-demand resourcing essentially means that when you need to provision a resource within the cloud, it’s almost immediately available to you to allocate where and when you need it. For example, if you had a server in the cloud and its CPU utilization was steadily increasing with demand, you’d be able to deploy a second server and it would be ready within minutes to take off some of the load of the first.</p>
<p>Now if you compare this to how you’re currently sourcing additional resources for your infrastructure, whether it be compute, storage or network, you will likely be going through a lengthy process. From engaging with your supplier, obtaining a quote and then defining and ordering the equipment, you will then have to wait for delivery of the new hardware, arrange for the installation of the equipment into a data center, where it can be cabled and configured before it’s ready to be released into the production environment. This whole process can take weeks depending on the equipment required. Weeks is often not good enough in today’s world. Sometimes days or even hours is too long to wait for additional resources when it’s required, specifically if it’s affecting your customers’ experience with you.</p>
<p>The on-demand resourcing aspect of cloud computing alleviates this issue entirely by providing almost instant access to a resource that you have selected and configured via a series of options.</p>
<p>Scalability, cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment’s resources, whether that’s compute, storage or network, both up and down and in and out depending on your requirements and demands of your applications and services. When scaling up and down, you are altering the power of an instance, perhaps using one with greater CPU power to scale up. When scaling in and out, you are simply adding or removing the number of instances you’re using.</p>
<p>It’s only because of the on-demand resourcing of the cloud that this scalability is possible. Imagine trying to quickly add additional servers and bring them online within your environment after a sudden surge of demand. Not only would this have huge financial implications impacting your budgets to cater for these potential peaks in additional assets, but it would also take valuable footprint space in your data center, which is also very expensive.</p>
<p>To give you an example of some of the scaling possibilities within the cloud, I want to review a couple of case studies. Firstly, Philips Healthcare, which focuses on consumer lifestyle, was able to scale out their infrastructure to analyze over 15 petabytes of patient data from over 390 million sources, such as medical records, imaging studies, and patient input. This data was then used to benefit the care of the patient. The cloud provider was able to reliably perform the operations required and scale to meet their needs at a growth rate of one petabyte a month. For more information on this case study, please use the following link.</p>
<p>Secondly, Airbnb managed to migrate and scale out their entire fleet of databases to AWS RDS, which is their Relational Database Service. They achieved all of this with only 15 minutes of service interruption. This was key to Airbnb as it didn’t want to impact their community users for a long period of time. For more information on this case study, please use the link below.</p>
<p>Economy of scale. Due to the huge scale of resources public cloud offerings provide, which are optimizing share between different tenants, you the end user benefit from exceptionally low compute, storage and network costs compared to traditional hosting.</p>
<p>As you will likely be aware, often when purchasing products, the more you buy, the cheaper it becomes. Public cloud providers can make use of this when buying compute, storage, and network infrastructure in such huge scales, and this allows them to pass on the savings to you. Purchasing at this capacity simply isn’t possible for the vast majority of organizations. This makes for very cheap resources within the cloud when compared to managing and hosting that same infrastructure on-premise.</p>
<p>Flexibility and elasticity. Cloud computing offers huge flexibility and elasticity to your design approach. You can choose to have as many or as few resources as you require without having to guess your capacity up front.</p>
<p>When your business experiences peaks and troughs of traffic for usage of your customer base, then architecting for these surges on-premises can be tricky to plan for as well as being potentially expensive. When doing so, you can base your resourcing provisions on usage history over the months or even years. But there were times when there will be inconsistencies. It’s these times that could see your customers suffering due to lack of resources to support their needs. This can cause a negative impact to your business reputation, something no one aspires to have. Consumers now expect to access what they need with an almost instant response. Having failing and slow response times could easily see them taking their business elsewhere. If you provide goods via a website, then this is especially true.</p>
<p>The sheer flexibility and elasticity of the cloud allows you to deploy different resources and services within minutes or seconds, and gives you the possibility to have as much or as little resource as and when needed. This is often coupled with automation, which can be built into cloud services, allowing your infrastructure to stretch and shrink elastically based on custom thresholds, ensuring your infrastructure will always deliver great service to your customers.</p>
<p>I have another case study whereby Unilever, who sell consumer goods such as food, homecare, and personal care products, had two goals to be reached by their cloud migration. Firstly, to deliver a common technology platform for the web content, and secondly, to migrate all their existing web properties to the cloud. This was achieved by utilizing over 400 instances using the flexibility of a VPC, virtual private cloud, in an auto scaling configuration to handle traffic loads. For more information on this case study, please see the link below.</p>
<p>Growth, cloud computing offers your organization the ability to grow using a wide range of resources and services. Couple this with the on-demand element, and your growth constraints are significantly reduced compared to a classic environment.</p>
<p>To enable your business to grow quickly and keep up with customer demand, it can be a struggle for some organizations that lucky enough to have that success, especially when providing services from an on-premise solution. You may need a larger building to house your infrastructure. This could take many months to acquire before being in a position to allow you to extend your network. If you are a startup company who has just happened to launch the next game that’s taking the mobile gaming market by storm, then it’s unfeasible to host and scale your infrastructure out to cope with the demand.</p>
<p>The growth that the cloud offers many businesses is almost limitless. With its rapid deployments the cloud offers the opportunity for your business to grow at exceptional rates.</p>
<p>Utility based metering. With many cloud services, you only pay for what you use. What do I mean by this? If you only have one server running for two hours and then shut it down, then you only pay for two hours’ worth of compute resources and that’s it. Think of it like this. In your house you only pay for electricity when you use it, and to help keep costs down, you turn off the lights when you are not using them. So it’s the same bit in process. You only pay for resources when you are using them.</p>
<p>Typically within a data center, your infrastructure is up and running 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365, always running, always on, but not always utilized. The power on coiling costs alone for this infrastructure can be phenomenal over the year, especially when you’re talking hundreds or even thousands of servers. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just go along and switch off the servers when you’re not using them? Well, in essence you could, but it rarely occurs, and even if you did, you’d still be paying for the footprint space that those servers took up.</p>
<p>The cloud offers you the ability to shut down any instance that isn’t in use. At that point you instantly stop paying for that resource. This could even be scripted. So for example, at 6:00 p.m. every day, all test and development servers are switched off, and then turned back on again at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<p>Shared infrastructure. Hosts within the cloud are virtualized. As a result multiple tenants can be running instances on the same piece of hardware, which significantly reduces the amount of physical hardware required, which in turn reduces the amount of power, coiling and space required in the data center. This all helps with economy of scale, all resulting in cheaper costs for you.</p>
<p>With some cloud providers you can in fact have a dedicated instance whereby no other customer can run instances on the same hardware that your instance is running on. Or for greater management and control, you can even have a dedicated host, which also prevents any other customer running instances on that same host. The difference between a dedicated instance and a dedicated host is that a dedicated host gives you far greater control and visibility, allowing you to decide which instances to place on that same host over the time period. Dedicated hosts also give you the visibility of sockets and cores which you can use to manage licensing on your own server-bound software, which is licensed per socket or per core. Dedicated instances do not give this control of the host, and they are automatically deployed on a host of the cloud provider’s choice.</p>
<p>The greater control and management reduces the overall optimization of that host, and as a result the cloud provider would compensate for this by charging you an increased price compared to that of the same instance type on a shared host.</p>
<p>So unless there are strict governance or security controls requiring you to have a dedicated host, or you have server license issues whereby you need to be able to see the sockets and cores of the server, then I would suggest using the shared tenancy option. By doing so, you would benefit from a greater cost savings across your overall cloud operating costs.</p>
<p>Highly available. By design many of the core services within the public cloud and its underlying infrastructure are replicated across different geographic zones and regions.</p>
<p>This alone can be huge to many businesses. To have offsite replication built into some services offers a significant advantage over on-premise business continuity solutions. Many organizations do not have the luxury of having multiple sites to replicate their data, or they are often too small to operate a wide-scale disaster recovery program. To have the availability and resiliency of the cloud helps to ensure the durability and availability of your data often without additional configuration dependent on the service type. It’s all provided by the vendor as a part of their service.</p>
<p>This offers great comfort to many businesses, but it’s important to understand at which point the resiliency is managed by the vendor and when it’s managed by you, the end user. You do not want to become too complacent and be caught out when disaster does strike. Understanding where the responsibility of the vendor stops from a resiliency perspective and where your responsibility starts varies from vendor-to-vendor and from service-to-service. Ensure you understand which services are managed by your chosen vendor as these managed services that often offer built-in management and resiliency which prevents you from having to architect such means. It’s one thing to add resources to the cloud, but architecting them in the resilient and highly available configuration is another.</p>
<p>Security, this is one of the most discussed topics within cloud computing and many enterprises still have concerns over how secure it is. However, public cloud vendors such as AWS, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure, are considered to be more secure than your own data center.</p>
<p>Public cloud vendors have to operate their security at an extremely high standard. They must adhere to global governance and compliances covering all industries and sectors. They are global services and as such must meet certifications from all over the world such as PCI DSS, ISO, HIPAA, and SOX. Trying to meet these standards in your local data center would be a struggle. Security is the number one topic that cloud vendors pour huge amounts of capital into to develop their security infrastructure further, advancing with technologies and developing new services to help the end users with securing their data. As a result the same level of security that large financial corporations require would be applied to an individual user who may be using the cloud to store their college documents. Security is a global service and meets global standards. To attain the level of security certification controlled and governance these vendors have within your own data center wouldn’t really be feasible and to a degree, unnecessary, as some compliances may not be applicable to your industry. However, utilizing their infrastructure covers you in their umbrella of security.</p>
<p>Public cloud vendors provide exceptional security for the underlying infrastructure of the cloud. It’s down to you and us, the end users, to then architect security in the cloud using the tools and services and applications available. As I previously mentioned, there are a number of ways we can secure our infrastructure, and it’s wise to get a security specialist to manage this aspect for you to apply security at every level of your deployments.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture, and I hope it’s provided an overview of how cloud technology can be used to change the way you manage your current workloads, and the benefits that the cloud can offer many organizations. Next we’ll be looking at the benefits that the cloud can bring to your business.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Business-Benefits"><a href="#Cloud-Business-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Business Benefits"></a>Cloud Business Benefits</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture. So we’ve covered some of the characteristics that the Cloud offers and reflected on how these can help you as an organization, should you decide to migrate. As you can see, there are some very compelling reasons to do so, so besides these positive points, you may ask yourself, okay, so the Cloud can offer advantages against my on-premise architecture, but my on-premise solution is working okay, so what else can the Cloud bring me as a business? Well the answer to that, other than the main financial aspect, is quite a lot. Let’s take a look at a few of those advantages.</p>
<p>The Cloud brings a new wave of life to your business and its architecture. You are presented with a whole new way of working, new ways of deployment, tools and services to help with automation, and self-healing of your infrastructure. It can be a little overwhelming when looking at how differently infrastructure operates within the Cloud. However, it’s very important to know how it operates, and how the Cloud, as a technology, is constantly evolving and developing.</p>
<p>When a technology like this exists, it’s potential and development can grow at an exponential rate. New services are being released that offer new ways of architecting your infrastructure all the time. This offers a massive potential within your business to innovate and take advantage of these changes. Your own on-premise solutions, likely remain the same month to month and year to year, with regards to technologies and deployment options. As a result, trying to innovate on top of this outdated infrastructure, would be hard and sometimes laborious to complete. It would take additional time, resulting in slow releases, which ultimately end in slower benefits offered to your customers. This whole process can be a drain on your budget.</p>
<p>The Cloud offers you the chance to work with some of the latest architecture and services, which wouldn’t always be as easy to acquire on-premise. Making use of new technologies, such as serverless computing, can be a game changer for many organizations. Imagine not having to configure, setup and manage any servers for your developed applications to run on. Imagine the only focus you needed for deploying your applications was the code, and that was it. Once you’d written your code, you can send it out to a service, and that service would provision all your infrastructure required to run that code for you. Deployment options such as this, especially for start ups, just wouldn’t be feasible.</p>
<p>You can be brave and experiment with new ideas and products at a fraction of the cost it would be, compared to an on-premise solution.</p>
<p>If you are operating within a business where you are bringing new products and applications or services to market, then the Cloud offers a great advantage in helping you to complete this over a standard, on-premise solution. You’re able to utilize all the resources you require in getting your products released. Having the desired resource you need when you need it, to scale up and speed the process up, can help you bring launch dates from months to weeks and to days. The Cloud is especially effective during your development and testing phase. Being able to do this and bring your product quicker to your customer, allows your organization to develop the next range of new products and releases even faster.</p>
<p>A fine example of bringing products to market quickly and effectively, is that of Netflix. Netflix is an online content provider of TV and films. Using the benefits of the Cloud, they’re are able to quickly deploy tens of thousands of servers, with terabytes of storage, within minutes, which serve over 1,000,000,000 hours worth of content per month.

<p>Within our current climate, governments globally are putting additional pressure on organizations to reduce their carbon footprint and become more green. In this fast paced world that we live in, businesses are struggling to meet these thresholds set out for climate change. And one of the largest culprits of carbon emissions is that of the power and energy used within our large data centers. Utilizing the Cloud to migrate some of your services can help offset some of this burden and lead to your organization becoming more green, which is a huge plus point for your business as a differentiator in leading change for the better.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, what’s the difference between having the infrastructure at my data center or in a Cloud provider’s data center? Well for one, all infrastructure is virtualized, as we know, and so it’s greatly optimized, whereas within your data center, this may not be the case. Also their power and cooling that’s providing, will likely be using far more energy effective mechanisms than that of the systems many of us utilize today. Cloud vendors will have huge data centers that would have had huge amounts of investment put into them. The latest efficiency and cooling technology would have been implemented, and probably in many instances, free air cooling may have been used, whereby outside air is brought into the data center through various means and filters to cool the infrastructure. It’s this kind of technology and implementations within their data centers, that help reduce the carbon footprint for everyone else using their infrastructure. Many of us are likely using outdated and older technologies when it comes to the mechanical and electrical infrastructure within our data centers, making it hard to compete with the efficiencies and greeness of the new, modern data centers used by the Cloud vendors today.</p>
<p>If architected correctly on the Cloud, your business infrastructure can be accessed from anywhere. This opens opportunity to you as a business, as it allows for a change of process when it comes to support and management of that infrastructure. Your entire Cloud management could be outsourced to another provider, which, depending on your current structure, may significantly reduce your IT operational costs from a salary perspective alone. Alternatively, it opens the door to increase the scope and sourcing talent for your organization. You can source your skilled IT engineers from almost anywhere, if all systems are available via the internet. For example, I live and work in the UK, however, Cloud Academy do not have any offices here. I can access all my work related services via the internet, over Cloud-based systems. As you can see, remote working becomes far more feasible for your employees, which in turn, could result in acquiring smaller offices and facilities, reducing costs even further.</p>
<p>Utilizing the Cloud allows you to reduce many of your business risks. One of your biggest risks is that of data durability, the loss or corruption of your own, or even your customer’s, data. We have already spoken about high availability, and the resiliency that it offers, and this will help with reducing that risk. However, you could even take this one step further, and utilize multiple Cloud vendors. Perhaps both AWS and Azure to hold customer data as an even greater risk mitigation strategy.</p>
<p>Product risks often come when moving from test and development to production. Much of this is down to the fact that it’s not always easy to replicate your test environment to reflect that of your production when on-premise. Largely, this is normally down to not having enough available resources. As a result, tests are often not completed to full requirements of a new product or service. With Cloud deployments, there are services that allow you to have the ability to copy your architecture exactly as it is in production, which can then deploy for testing where it’s built exactly the same. You can have this purely for the period only required for testing, and then remove the infrastructure so you stop paying for it. So now, you’re able to fully test, from end to end, as if it were in a production environment for a small cost, mitigating a lot of the existing risks you would have had otherwise, resulting in a more reliable release for your customers.</p>
<p>Time is something all businesses wish they had more of, deliverables and deadlines are always rushed, and as a result, processes and procedures are always challenged. Cloud adoption changes the way your business will operate. It will become significantly more dynamic, it’s approach to change will often become swift and smooth. In a well designed environment, your organization will end up spending far less time focusing on your IT solutions, and the management of those underlying solutions, as much of the maintenance and operational aspects would be automated and managed by the Cloud vendor. It’s then this time, that would have otherwise been spent on these tasks, and allows you to use it focusing more on the delivery of the core functions of the business, your products and your services.</p>
<p>Having your infrastructure within the Cloud makes it more feasible to have real-time collaborations between your business and other third parties that you utilize to drive forward and sell your services. Opening up access to certain data and services for authorized third party vendors to interrogate and analyze on your behalf, can be of significant benefit. There are many approved partners that have been sanctioned by public Cloud providers that can provide some incredible monitoring and analysis of your data, which can ultimately lead to a change of business strategy, making your organization stronger within the market.</p>
<p>That brings us to the end of this lecture, coming up next, we look at the constraints of Cloud computing and where you may experience restrictions in your migrations.</p>
