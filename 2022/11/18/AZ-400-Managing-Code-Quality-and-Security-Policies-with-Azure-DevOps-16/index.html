        <h1 id="Course-Introduction"><a href="#Course-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course Introduction"></a>Course Introduction</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to managing code quality and security policies with Azure DevOps. My name is Thomas Mitchell and I will be taking you through this course.</p>
<p>I am in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> instructor at Cloud Academy and I have over 25 years of IT experience, several of those with cloud technologies. If you have any questions about this course, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is intended for those who are preparing for the AZ-400 exam. To get the most from this course, you should have a basic understanding of Microsoft Azure and of DevOps concepts.</p>
<p>We will start things off by looking at the definition of code quality. After defining what code quality means, we’ll dive into what it takes to write high-quality code.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at what goes into code quality scanning and at how SonarCloud can help monitor code quality.</p>
<p>Once we’ve worked through code quality scanning and monitoring code quality, you’ll see a hands-on demonstration that shows you how to use SonarCloud in the pipeline.</p>
<p>As we progress, we’ll look at what code coverage means and how to use the “Publish Code Coverage Results” task to report on code coverage.</p>
<p>Later on, we’ll touch on security policies, where you’ll learn about the OWASP and its Top-10 list. We’ll take a look at 5 of the top entries in the OWASP Top-10.</p>
<p>We’ll round out the course by looking at a couple of popular security analysis tools.</p>
<p>By the time you finish this course, you should have the foundational knowledge that is required to effectively manage code quality and security policies.</p>
<p>We would love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. If you’re ready to learn about code quality and security policies, let’s get started!</p>

<h1 id="Code-Quality-Defined"><a href="#Code-Quality-Defined" class="headerlink" title="Code Quality Defined"></a>Code Quality Defined</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to Code Quality Defined. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what qualifies as quality code.</p>
<p>When you set out to write code that is required to perform a certain function, you will often find that there is not necessarily one right way to write the code. As they say, there is more than one way to skin a cat. Now, that being said, there ARE wrong ways to write code – and when you fall into bad habits, your code quality will suffer as a result. So, what do you have to do to maintain your code quality?</p>
<p>For starters, the code that you write needs to function as expected. That’s a given. If your code doesn’t do what you want it to do, it really doesn’t qualify as high-quality code, now does it? </p>
<p>Aside from ensuring that your code performs as expected, you must also ensure that your code is clear and readable. This is important because you are likely not going to be the only one reading your code and trying to modify or enhance it. If it isn’t clear, it’s going to be difficult for others to work with it. </p>
<p>Speaking of others working with your code, it’s also critical that your code be thoroughly documented. Your documentation should be clear enough that others can follow it. </p>
<p>While readability and documentation are critical to maintaining code quality, efficiency is also important. That being the case, it’s critical that your code runs efficiently. If your code can complete a task in 2 seconds instead of 10 seconds, make that happen – and make it happen without wasting resources – because resource waste isn’t all that efficient. </p>
<p>So, now that you have a clean set of code that’s documented, readable by others, and efficiently performs the task it was meant to perform, you have to ask yourself, “Is my code maintainable?”</p>
<p>While the previously mentioned characteristics are important to creating quality code, the maintainability of the code is also important. So, what this means is that you have to write your code in a manner that makes it easy for others to work with it. To do this, what you really want to do is eliminate overly long code modules. </p>
<p>There are several other characteristics of quality code. They include style, extensibility, and security.</p>
<p>When writing code, the code should always adhere to agreed-upon standards that might include specific coding standards, formatting standards, and naming standards. Every person that will be working on your code should recognize these standards and they should adhere to them. </p>
<p>Because code will often evolve over time – sometimes rapidly, the code that you write must be extensible. If it’s not, these evolutions over time can become painful and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Lastly, code must be secure. In today’s world, this is really the most important characteristic of quality code. Because security breaches and holes can be created through poor coding practices, it’s important that you keep security at the forefront when writing your code.</p>
<p>Now, in utopia, your code would meet all the qualifications that we previously touched on. But this isn’t utopia. In reality, your code isn’t going to rate highly for all of these qualifications. That’s just a fact of life. That being the case, you have to be aware of the technical debt that you incur whenever you write “less than stellar” code – because the more that your code fails in any one of these areas, the more technical debt it is going to incur.</p>
<p>So, if you know what it takes to write quality code, how does poorly written code happen? </p>
<p>Well, if you ask most coders, they will usually give you the same answer: tight deadlines. This is because when a developer is tasked with getting a project done quickly, they will usually be forced to take shortcuts. These shortcuts allow the developer to get the code written more quickly, but at a cost.</p>
<p>For example, instead of refactoring an existing method to include new functionality, the developer will often just copy the method to create a new version. Coding in this fashion is certainly faster than the refactoring and the testing that would otherwise be necessary. </p>
<p>An organization with no defined coding standards will also result in poor code quality because the organization’s developers won’t really know what they should be producing. </p>
<p>There are, in reality, all kinds of reasons for poor quality code development. But the ones I mentioned already, along with a simple lack of technical skills, are really the main reasons.</p>
<p>To help improve code quality, what you should do is implement automated code testing. This is because automated testing can help identify issues without manual work involved. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s critical to maintain high-quality code, because regardless of how poor code comes to be, the end result is that the DevOps people wind up spending the majority of their time on fixing bugs, rather than delivering better functionality to your customers.</p>

<h1 id="Monitoring-Code-Quality"><a href="#Monitoring-Code-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring Code Quality"></a>Monitoring Code Quality</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to Monitoring Code Quality.</p>
<p>Writing code can certainly be a chore. Quite often, developers are tasked with just getting code to work – often under tight deadlines. That being the case, code quality is often not really top of mind. That’s not good, because, in order to avoid technical debt, improved code quality and efficiency should always be one of the main goals in any DevOps project. Maintaining code quality requires that you ensure that your developers are writing quality code. Implementing code quality scanning, which is an automated system for providing code feedback, can be very useful for improving code quality.</p>
<p>Scanning your code quality like this is quite similar to grammar and spell-check in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft</a> Word. It allows you to improve the final product, because, code quality maintenance should be top of mind throughout a project’s lifecycle. The reasoning is pretty straightforward. Issues with code quality will usually accumulate if left unchecked. This leads to snowballing technical debt, which, in turn, results in difficult and time-consuming software maintenance.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to mitigate this technical debt is to address code quality issues as early as possible in the development process.</p>
<p>Tools and techniques that you can leverage to improve code quality include things like enforcement of coding standards, proper training, regular and ongoing code reviews, and automated quality analysis.</p>
<p>That automated quality analysis piece is what we are concerned about here. Automated quality analysis tools, or static code analysis tools, are used to help maintain high code quality. Such tools are immensely helpful to developers because they can scan code and flag vulnerabilities. These tools include things like SonarCloud.</p>
<p>What these tools do is identify code quality issues and track trends over time. Using these tools allows developers to view the current code health of a project along with historic code health of the project.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss how SonarCloud can be used to help with code quality monitoring.</p>
<p>To ensure high-quality code, you can use SonarCloud to automatically analyze your code by reading it right from your repository. You don’t need to configure a CI-based analysis.</p>
<p>To make this happen, you need to import a project that’s compatible with Automatic Analysis. Once you’ve imported your projects, SonarCloud will analyze the default branch. A new analysis will be triggered automatically after every new push on the default branch and after any pull request activity.</p>
<p>I should point out, however, that Automatic Analysis, at the time of this course publication, is only available for GitHub repositories – and can only be activated on projects bound to a repository. </p>
<p>To activate Automatic Analysis with SonarCloud for a new project, you need to import the project from GitHub. Once imported, SonarCloud automatically triggers a compatibility check to ensure that the project is compatible with Automatic Analysis. If it is, SonarCloud triggers an initial analysis. If it’s not compatible, SonarCloud will suggest other analysis methods. For example, it may recommend using a CI tool.</p>
<p>To use Automatic Analysis for an existing project, you would just browse to your project’s Analysis Method page in SonarCloud and turn Automatic Analysis on. Once the compatibility check finishes, SonarCloud will make recommendations for your specific project. </p>
<p>Later on, in this course, I’ll show you how to use SonarCloud in a build pipeline.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-on-Code-Coverage"><a href="#Reporting-on-Code-Coverage" class="headerlink" title="Reporting on Code Coverage"></a>Reporting on Code Coverage</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Reporting on Code Coverage. In this lesson, we are going take a look at how you can report on your code overage, using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps.</p>
<p>Before we dive into DevOps, let’s quickly define what code coverage means. Code coverage is the proportion of code within a project that’s tested through things like unit tests. Ensuring that a large portion of your code is tested helps guard against bugs – this is why code coverage is so important.</p>
<p>Reporting on code coverage allows you to identify code paths that are not covered by tests. You can use this information to reduce your test debt.</p>
<p>The “Publish Code Coverage Results Task” is a task in a build pipeline you use to publish code coverage results that are produced when you run tests to Azure Pipelines or TFS to obtain coverage reporting. This task supports coverage result formats like Cobertura and JaCoCo.</p>
<p>I should note that the “Publish Code Coverage Results Task” can only be used in Build pipelines. It’s not supported in Release pipelines.</p>
<p>Other tasks, like Visual Studio Test, .NET Core, Ant, Maven, and some others also offer the option to publish code coverage data to the pipeline. When using these tasks, you don’t need a separate Publish Code Coverage Results task in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Before you can produce the HTML code coverage report, you’ll have to install dotnet 2.0.0 or later on the agent. In addition, the dotnet folder has to be included in the environment path. </p>
<p>The YAML snippet that you see on your screen is required to publish the code coverage results.</p>
<p>In this snippet you see, both the codeCoverageTool and summaryFileLocation parameters are mandatory.</p>
<p>The summaryFileLocation argument is a required parameter. It’s the path to the summary files that contain the code coverage statistics. The pathToSources argument is the path to your source files. This argument is only required when coverage XML reports do not contain an absolute path to the source files. The failIfCoverageEmpty argument is an optional argument that fails the task if code coverage doesn’t produce any results to publish.</p>
<p>If you are using Docker, builds and tests can run inside the container. This allows you to generate code coverage results right within the container itself. If you wish to publish the results to your pipeline, the resulting artifacts have to be made available to the Publish Code Coverage Results task. </p>
<p>Once you’ve generated your code coverage results, the code coverage summary can be viewed in your build timeline view. You can use this summary to see the overall percentage of line coverage.</p>
<p>You can view the code coverage artifacts that were published during the build under the Build artifacts published milestone in the timeline view.</p>
<p>If you use Cobertura or JaCoCo coverage formats to publish your code coverage, the code coverage artifact will contain an HTML file that you can view offline as well.</p>

<h1 id="The-OWASP-Top-Ten"><a href="#The-OWASP-Top-Ten" class="headerlink" title="The OWASP Top Ten"></a>The OWASP Top Ten</h1><p>Hello and welcome to the OWASP Top 10. The term OWASP refers to The Open Web Application Security Project. </p>
<p>The Open Web Application Security Project is an international organization dedicated to helping organizations conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. The information that OWASP provides is free and is open to anyone that wants to improve application security.</p>
<p>The Open Web Application Security Project is probably most known for its Top 10 list. Their Top 10 list highlights common issues in web applications. This list is designed to help minimize exposure to risks associated with these common issues.</p>
<p>Just to give you a feel for what OWASP is all about, let’s look at some of the top issues mentioned in their Top 10 list.</p>
<p>The top security risk on the OWASP Top 10 at the time of this course publication is Injection. Because injection flaws like SQL injections and LDAP injections occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, you should get into the habit of never trusting any user input. You should also never execute any code that’s built directly from untrusted input.</p>
<p>Broken Authentication takes the number two spot on the OWASP Top 10. This shows up because application functions that are related to authentication and session management are, many times, implemented incorrectly. This allows the bad guys to compromise passwords, keys, and even session tokens. </p>
<p>Number three on the OWASP Top 10 is Sensitive Data Exposure. This shows up because lots of web applications and APIs do a poor job of protecting sensitive data. As a result, hackers can often steal or modify this poorly protected data to commit credit card fraud, identity theft, and other crimes. </p>
<p>XML External Entities comes in at number four on the Top 10 because lots of older and poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. This is an issue because external entities can be used to reveal internal files via the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five on the OWASP Top 10 is Broken Access Control. Broken Access Control shows up because restrictions on what authenticated users can and can’t do are, quite often, not properly enforced. These flaws are then exploited to access unauthorized functionality or data.</p>
<p>To ensure a more secure software development environment, organizations should adopt the OWASP Top 10 as part of their development process.</p>

<h1 id="Security-Analysis-Tools"><a href="#Security-Analysis-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Security Analysis Tools"></a>Security Analysis Tools</h1><p>Azure DevOps can be integrated with a wide range of other tools that can help in checking code for vulnerabilities. Common tools include SonarCloud and White Source Bolt. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what each product is and what each offers.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking a look at SonarCloud. SonarCloud is a code analysis service that runs in the cloud. It’s the cloud version of the on-prem product called SonarQube. SonarCloud is used to identify code quality issues in roughly two dozen different programming languages. It allows organizations to continuously ensure maintainability and security of their code.</p>
<p>What SonarCloud does is perform static code analysis to identify issues in the code that you write. This static analysis does not require you to actually run the code like dynamic analysis does. This provides an additional layer of code verification that is different and separate from automated testing and human code-review.</p>
<p>Using SonarCloud allows you to detect problems with your code earlier in the process, which, in turn, ensures that fewer issues find their way into the later stages of the build process. This helps improve the overall quality of the final production code.</p>
<p>To use SonarCloud, you connect it to whatever cloud-based code repository service that you are currently using. It supports GitHub, Bitbucket Cloud, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps Services, and GitLab.</p>
<p>When you sign up for SonarCloud, you specify the repository provider that you want to connect to, and then your SonarCloud account is created and bound to your account on your chosen repository provider.</p>
<p>I should point out that SonarCloud does not work with on-prem code repositories. If you need support for on-prem repositories, you should use what is essentially the on-prem version of SonarCloud, which is called SonarQube.</p>
<p>Once you sign up for SonarCloud, you can use it to identify issues and security hotspots in your code.</p>
<p>Issues, as you might expect, are problems in your code that require fixing. The types of issues that SonarCloud can detect include Code Smells, Bugs, and Vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Code Smells typically don’t prevent your program from functioning properly but might indicate deeper problems that can cause maintainability issues for the code. </p>
<p>Bugs are coding errors that can cause the program to not operate as expected. </p>
<p>Vulnerabilities are coding problems that may be exploited by bad guys in order to compromise the security of your application.</p>
<p>While SonarCloud is very good at detecting coding issues, it also identifies security hotspots, which are parts of code that could cause security issues. </p>
<p>By integrating SonarCloud into your software development process, you can prevent issues from reaching production. You can actually integrate SonarCloud in three different places. It integrates with the editor, in the pull request, and in the codebase.</p>
<p>For example, SonarLint, which is SonarCloud’s companion product, is used to provide immediate feedback from within the editor. This allows developers to catch issues before they reach the repository.</p>
<p>By annotating the pull request interface of your repository service, SonarCloud can provide the results of its analysis on the pull request branch right in the interface – and can automatically grant or deny the approval of the pull request, depending on your defined quality gate criteria. This allows you to add automatic code review to your process.</p>
<p>Because some types of issues can only be identified after code is merged, SonarCloud often needs to analyze your entire codebase as a single unit. To accomplish this, SonarCloud offers two different approaches. They include automatic analysis and CI-based Analysis.</p>
<p>To provide automatic analysis, SonarCloud detects every pull request that is merged and then analyzes the new state of the code in your repository. </p>
<p>CI-based analysis is the configuration of SonarCloud so that it performs analysis as part of your regular continuous integration (CI) process or build process.</p>
<p>What SonarCloud does is focus on identifying issues that are found in incoming changes as they arrive. This aligns with the principle of “cleaning as you code”, which focuses on preventing issues in incoming new code. This eliminates, or at least mitigates, the need for digging through old code to identify issues within it. </p>
<p>While SonarCloud is the most common security tool, WhiteSource Bolt is another security and management solution that I want to touch on here. </p>
<p>WhiteSource Bolt a lightweight open-source offering that, when integrated within Azure DevOps Services &amp; Team Foundation Server, allows you to detect and remedy vulnerable open source components, generate open-source inventory reports, and enforce open source license compliance. You can also use WhiteSource Bolt to identify outdated open-source libraries and recommendations.</p>

<h1 id="DEMO-Configuring-SonarCloud-in-a-Pipeline"><a href="#DEMO-Configuring-SonarCloud-in-a-Pipeline" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Configuring SonarCloud in a Pipeline"></a>DEMO: Configuring SonarCloud in a Pipeline</h1><p>Welcome back. In this brief demonstration, what we’re going to do is configure SonarCloud in a pipeline. What we’re first going to do is activate SonarCloud for our DevOps subscription here. On the screen here you can see I’m logged into my DevOps subscription. I have the Parts Unlimited project that was generated by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps Demo Generator here, and this is the project we’re going to work with.</p>
<p>So what we need to do first here is to set up the SonarCloud extension for our subscription. And to do that from that screen, we click the marketplace icon here and we browse the marketplace. Now from the extensions search bar here, we’re simply going to search for SonarCloud. And we can see we have a couple of different options.</p>
<p>We have the SonarCloud extension here, we have the Quality Gate and we have the build breaker along with an SP Tool that allows SonarCloud to run for .Net Core projects on prem actually. What we’re going to do here is install the SonarCloud extension. So we’ll select our SonarCloud and then we’ll click Get it Free. And then from here, we’re going to select our DevOps organization and in this example, I only have the single DevOps organization called DevOps9878 and we’ll go ahead and install it. And once it’s installed, we can proceed back to the organization.</p>
<p>Once we’re back in our organization here, we’ll select our Parts Unlimited project here. Now from our Parts Unlimited project here, what we’re going to do is create a new pipeline. So let’s go ahead and select pipelines here and we can see we already have a recently run pipeline which we are not going to use.</p>
<p>What we’ll do here is click new pipeline and then what I’m going to do here is show you how you can use the classic editor to create a pipeline without YAML. There’s a way to do that as well. And to do that, we simply select the Use The Classic Editor here, and from here, we’re going to leave the source as our Azure Repos Git and we have our Parts Unlimited team project, our PartsUnlimited repository, and of course the Master default branch, we’ll go ahead and continue here.</p>
<p>Now, what we can do here is select our template. We can either search for the template, or if we scroll down here we can see the.NET templates that were added by SonarCloud. For this example, we’ll use the.NET Desktop with SonarCloud.</p>
<p>Now, what we can see here is that we have some settings that need attention. We need to configure the Agent pool. Now what we’re going to do for this demonstration is select Azure hosted. And then what we’ll do here for the agent specification is we’ll select the vs2017 for this example, and then what we’ll do here is we’ll prepare analysis on SonarCloud.</p>
<p>Now on this screen, we can see we have to configure some information. We need to configure a service endpoint so that this build can connect to SonarCloud to perform the analysis. We need to specify our organization and a project key.</p>
<p>Now, if I select the drop down here for my service endpoint, I can say I don’t have any service endpoints created right now.</p>
<p>Now to create this service endpoint, I can either go through the manage link here and create a service connection for SonarCloud, which takes me to my new SonarCloud service connection window. Or if I close this out and click New, it takes me right to the window.</p>
<p>In either case, I need to provide a SonarCloud token. Now to get that I need to set this up in my SonarCloud account. So we’ll close this out and we’ll open up sonarcloud.io. </p>
<p>Now here I’m logged into my SonarCloud account. And if I go into my account here if I go into Security, I can generate a token. I’m just going to call this My Token, and we’ll generate it. And we can see that my token has been created and we’ll copy this.</p>
<p>We go back out to Parts Unlimited, we can go ahead and create our end point, provide our token here, we verify it, we can see our verification has succeeded, and we’re just going to call this MyConnection. At this point, we’ll verify and save it, and we now have our end point connection created.</p>
<p>Now in the organization drop down here, I can select my TestOrg9878 Now this TestOrg9878 comes from my account in SonarCloud where I have a TestOrg9878 organization defined. Now this Project Key needs to be globally unique so we’ll create a Project Key for this project.</p>
<p>So with my Project Key configured here, we have all of the required information completed and we can go ahead and save and queue. We can leave everything here at its default and we’ll go ahead and run it.</p>
<p>Welcome back. So now that our analysis has completed, let’s go ahead and take a look at what the output is. On the screen here I’m in my pipeline screen for my Parts Unlimited project. We can see the recently run pipeline for Parts Unlimited. This is the.NET Desktop with SonarCloud.</p>
<p>We can go ahead and select our run, from here we can select the description for our run. We see the warnings that were generated as part of our run. Now from here, what we can do is click on Tests and we can see that we had 16 total tests. We can see that we had 14 passed and two other state. And then if we click on extensions here, we can see that we have a detailed SonarCloud report available.</p>
<p>So we’ll go ahead and click on our report. This takes us out to SonarCloud where we can see a full report that is returned for our analysis. We can see we had 89 total bugs for vulnerabilities, we had some security hotspots or lots of security hotspots, I should say. And we can see our coverage report here’s what I’m really interested in for this.</p>
<p>If we hover over the icon here, we can see that this represents the percentage of lines of code covered by our tests. A 0.3% code coverage is probably not what we’re after. Now, we’re not after perfection here because I just wanted to show you how to work through the process of using SonarCloud with your pipeline.</p>
<p>If we select our vulnerabilities here, we can see that we should be refactoring code to not perform redirects, we should be refactoring code to not reflect user controlled data and we should be making some other changes here. We go back out to Overview, we can go ahead and select our bugs and we can see there are all kinds of bugs in our code. So that is how you integrate SonarCloud into your build pipeline.</p>

<h1 id="Course-Summary"><a href="#Course-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Course Summary"></a>Course Summary</h1><p>Congratulations. You’ve come to the end of Managing Code Quality and Security Policies with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> DevOps. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We kicked things off by looking at the definition of code quality. After defining what code quality means, we dove into what it takes to write high-quality code.</p>
<p>Next, we looked at what goes into code quality scanning and at how SonarCloud can help monitor code quality.</p>
<p>Once we worked through code quality scanning and through monitoring code quality, you saw a hands-on demonstration that showed you how to use SonarCloud in the pipeline.</p>
<p>As we progressed, we looked at what code coverage means and how to use the “Publish Code Coverage Results” task to report on code coverage.</p>
<p>Later on, we touched on security policies, where you learned about the OWASP and its Top-10 list. We took a look at 5 of the top entries in the OWASP Top-10.</p>
<p>We rounded things out by looking at a couple of popular security analysis tools.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have the foundational knowledge that is required to effectively Manage Code Quality and Security Policies with Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>To learn more about Managing Code Quality and Security Policies with Azure DevOps, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy, because we’re always publishing new ones. Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching and happy learning.</p>
