        <h1 id="SAA-C03-Learning-Path-Introduction"><a href="#SAA-C03-Learning-Path-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="SAA-C03 Learning Path Introduction"></a>SAA-C03 Learning Path Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this learning path, which has been designed to help you prepare for and pass the latest version of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam, SAA-C03.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Danny Jessee, and I am one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS–Amazon Web Services–and AWS certifications. Feel free to connect with me to ask any questions using the details shown on the screen. Alternatively, you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#117;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#100;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#115;&#x75;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#64;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#117;&#x64;&#x61;&#x63;&#x61;&#100;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a>, where one of our cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam is designed for anyone who has knowledge and experience designing cloud solutions that use AWS services. It allows individuals within a solutions architect role to verify and validate their knowledge by effectively demonstrating their ability to architect solutions using best practice design principles in a secure and robust way. This learning path will provide you with the knowledge you need when preparing to take the latest version of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam, which was released in August 2022.</p>
<p>The certification itself is broken down into four distinct domains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design Secure Architectures,</li>
<li>Design Resilient Architectures,</li>
<li>Design High-Performing Architectures, and</li>
<li>Design Cost-Optimized Architectures</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these domains carry a specific percentage weighting within the exam. Each domain also contains a series of task statements that identify specific required knowledge and skills. These are all outlined in the official AWS exam guide that you can find here. There is also a clickable link to this guide in the Course Material section for this course. Let’s start by taking a closer look at each of these domains to give you a better understanding of the topics that will be covered on the exam.</p>
<p>Domain 1: Design Secure Architectures. This domain accounts for 30% of the exam content and focuses on 3 key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design secure access to AWS resources,</li>
<li>Design secure workloads and applications, and</li>
<li>Determine appropriate data security controls</li>
</ul>
<p>For this domain, you’ll need to know how to design secure access to AWS and the resources you use within it. You’ll need to understand how to design secure application tiers and be able to recommend and select the most appropriate security services and features to protect your data.</p>
<p>This learning path has tons of content that will help you understand all of these elements. One of the main services you’ll need to know and be familiar with is AWS Identity and Access Management, known as IAM, so we’ll cover this in some detail, along with how to configure federated access. You’ll be introduced to Amazon Cognito, as well as AWS Organizations, in particular, the Service Control Policies that this service offers.</p>
<p>From an application security standpoint, we’ll focus on the AWS Web Application Firewall, or WAF, along with an introduction to AWS Firewall Manager and AWS Shield. Logging is also a critical element of application security, so you’ll learn how to enable logging and use it to your advantage from a security standpoint. You’ll understand how services such as AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail can be used to help you audit, monitor and evaluate your infrastructure for security issues and incidents, helping you resolve threats more quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>From a data security perspective, you’ll learn how to protect your data using the AWS Key Management Service, known as KMS, to encrypt your data across multiple services, in addition to learning how to manage and configure multiple encryption mechanisms that are used by Amazon S3.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have Domain 2: Design Resilient Architectures. This domain accounts for 26% of the exam content and focuses on 2 key areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design scalable and loosely coupled architectures, and</li>
<li>Design highly available and&#x2F;or fault-tolerant architectures</li>
</ul>
<p>This domain will assess your knowledge of how to design a multi-tier architecture and ensure your solutions are highly available and fault-tolerant.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you’ll be introduced to the AWS global infrastructure, providing you with a foundation for how the underlying architecture is pieced together on a global scale. We’ll discuss how to implement multi-tier architectures within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC, using multiple subnets and other networking components. You’ll also be introduced to Amazon Route 53 and CloudFront, along with some common disaster recovery and business continuity strategies.</p>
<p>You’ll learn about the benefits of, as well as the differences between decoupled and event-driven architectures, along with some of the AWS services that allow you to implement them, such as the Amazon Simple Notification Service, or SNS, the Amazon Simple Queue Service, or SQS, Amazon Kinesis, and AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>Storage also plays an important part in this domain, and you’ll need to demonstrate your awareness of resilient storage capabilities within your architectures. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how AWS storage services can be used to help maintain your data from a resiliency standpoint, including Amazon S3, AWS Storage Gateway, and Amazon EFS to name a few.</p>
<p>Next, we have Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures. This domain accounts for 24% of the exam content and focuses on the following 5 items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine high-performing and&#x2F;or scalable storage solutions,</li>
<li>Design high-performing and elastic compute solutions,</li>
<li>Determine high-performing database solutions,</li>
<li>Determine high-performing and&#x2F;or scalable network architectures, and</li>
<li>Determine high-performing data ingestion and transformation solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This domain will assess your ability to design high-performing architectures that leverage AWS storage, compute, database, and networking services.</p>
<p>So again, you’ll be assessed on your knowledge of AWS storage services, but this time from a high-performance and scalability perspective. We’ll look deeper into Amazon EFS and its configuration, plus gain insight into additional performance features within Amazon S3.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to know which services to use and configure when implementing elastic and scalable solutions for compute workloads. So we’ll cover the configuration of Amazon EC2 auto scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, as well as services such as the Amazon Elastic Container Service, or ECS.</p>
<p>This domain will also test your awareness and knowledge of database performance and how to manage workloads across your databases. We’ll introduce you to many of the different AWS database services to give you foundational knowledge of the different services that are available before honing in on some of the performance options such as high availability with Amazon RDS using Multi-AZ features, as well as options for high availability across Amazon DynamoDB and Aurora. You’ll also be introduced to the Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator, known as DAX, which can boost your database performance tenfold by using cached clusters.</p>
<p>From a networking standpoint, you’ll need to know how to architect network infrastructure that can effectively support different types of workloads, so we’ll focus on many of the VPC networking components you can use. This includes everything from the fundamentals of the VPC itself, including subnets, Elastic Network Interfaces and Adapters, or ENIs and ENAs, to security controls and considerations, including Network Access Control Lists, or NACLs, security groups, NAT Gateways, and bastion hosts, plus connectivity options such as VPC endpoints, Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, Direct Connect, AWS Transit Gateway, and the AWS Global Accelerator.</p>
<p>And finally, we have Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures. This domain accounts for 20% of the exam content and will assess you in 4 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design cost-optimized storage solutions,</li>
<li>Design cost-optimized compute solutions,</li>
<li>Design cost-optimized database solutions, and</li>
<li>Design cost-optimized network architectures</li>
</ul>
<p>This domain looks at cost optimization across all of your architectures, so it’s important to understand the different cost metrics for AWS Cloud services and how you can optimize their configuration.</p>
<p>We’ll spend time looking at the costs associated with different AWS storage services to ensure you understand the full spectrum of price points associated with them, such as storage classes within Amazon S3, Glacier, or even specific management elements of a service like provisioned throughput in EFS. We’ll also look at data retrieval and data transfer using services such as AWS Storage Gateway, AWS Backup, and more.</p>
<p>You’ll be introduced to compute savings plans and reserved instances, and you’ll see how these can be optimized to save you money across your EC2 fleets. You’ll see how to manage and monitor your database costs with RDS. And finally, you’ll review the features and best practices to consider when designing a cost-optimized network architecture.</p>
<p>Throughout this learning path, you’ll be guided through a series of courses, hands-on labs, and assessments that will cover every element within the domains I just discussed. And you can rest assured that these courses, labs and assessments have been curated by a team of highly certified and experienced trainers, all of whom have passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam. This collective and collaborative effort leveraging our own exam experience allows us to create content that’s honed in on the specific topics you’ll need to know in order to pass this exam!</p>
<p>Feedback on our learning paths here at Cloud Academy is valuable to both us as trainers and any students looking to take the same learning path in the future. If you have any feedback, positive or negative, or if you notice anything that needs to be updated or corrected for the next release cycle, it would be greatly appreciated if you could email <a href="mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#x40;&#99;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#x61;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x74;&#x40;&#99;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x75;&#x64;&#x61;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#x65;&#109;&#x79;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>.</p>
<p>That brings me to the end of this introduction. So now you have an understanding of what’s involved, let’s get you prepped and ready to tackle this certification! Coming up next, we’ll take a more in-depth look at the mechanics of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam.</p>
<h1 id="The-Mechanics-of-the-Exam"><a href="#The-Mechanics-of-the-Exam" class="headerlink" title="The Mechanics of the Exam"></a>The Mechanics of the Exam</h1><p>The AWS Solutions Architect exam has 65 questions and you will have 130 minutes to complete it, this is just over two hours, if you do the math, you’ll have about two minutes to answer each question. Some questions read faster than others. Likewise, there will be questions that are simply put easy to answer. The two minute per question is just an average. However, if you’re prepared, none of the questions will take that long to answer.</p>
<p>Each of the 65 questions falls into one of four domains. A passing score is 720 points out of a possible 1,000. This is a scaled score, that is internally AWS gives some questions more weight than others. Also inside the exam guide is a paragraph that has the heading Unscored Content. It says, “Your examination may include non-scored questions that are placed on the test to gather statistical information.”</p>
<p>Non-scored means exactly that, right or wrong they have no impact on whether or not you’ll pass the exam. You will not know which ones they are, why they’re included or if you got them correct or not. If you’ve spent any amount of time with AWS you have either attended or watched videos of re:Invent. New services are often referred to as an MVP, a Minimally Viable Product, then over time these services get more features and become more robust.</p>
<p>A passing score of 720 is similar though instead of being minimally viable, it’s more like you’re minimally qualified. Minimally qualified means that you have enough skills to get the job done and be recognized as such. I think of it like television shows and movies that feature doctors they sometimes talk about their oath to first, do no harm. That’s at the core of what being minimally qualified means. You can do the work without doing harm to yourself, others or the data in your care.</p>
<p>Let’s look at that idea of doing the work. The exam is designed to test real-world AWS knowledge and concepts that are relevant and current. It will avoid trivial knowledge like button placement or things that would normally require consulting documentation when needed. Instead it tests common and important tasks that are relevant to a developer’s role. This includes evaluating the ability to solve problems improve performance, troubleshoot, or improve security.</p>
<p>In essence, the exam tests competency and not theoretical or trivial knowledge. By trivial knowledge, I mean technical jargon, local terminology, workplace specific verbiage, and complex language. These things do not measure ability and are not found on the exam. If the exam tests competency, how does it do that? The answer is actually found in the exam guide. It is important to review and understand the exam guide because each question is written to measure your knowledge of a specific skill against one of its stated objectives.</p>
<p>What most people think of as a test question really has three parts, a scenario a specific question about that scenario and a set of possible answers. The scenario is officially known as a STEM and is the setup for a question, its purpose is to introduce the concept being evaluated. STEMS include all of the details needed to make an informed decision about the correct answer.</p>
<p>The question that follows the STEM focuses on a single concept or aspect of AWS that is directly related to the exam guide. You are only tested on one thing at a time. That is a question could ask for a solution that is highly available or cost-effective, but not both. Common question themes include being highly available, cost effective, the most secure, performance improvement and the least amount of downtime. You will not be asked for the best or easiest solution because what’s best for you might be the worst for someone else. Instead, questions often have qualifiers that identify a situation, examples include which of these options is the most cost-effective? Which action has no downtime? Which has the least amount of latency?</p>
<p>AWS exam questions focus on the use of its services and features, that is you’re being tested on whether or not you have the knowledge and skills needed to implement solutions. This means you will not need to memorize the tails like performance metrics for EC2 instances, service limits, the syntax for the AWS CLI and prices for various services. Thinking back to what I said earlier this is trivial information and are things that could easily be looked up at the time of implementation, they are not worthy of being on the exam.</p>
<p>Before I move on to a description of the responses, there’s one other thing I want to share regarding the questions, they are either open-ended or closed. An open-ended question does not end with a question mark. These are typically fact-based statements that are cut off mid sentence and have response options which complete the sentence in a grammatically correct way. For example, AWS is an acronym that stands for Amazon Web A, systems, B, services C, solutions or D, structures? If you don’t know this, you might be in the wrong place.</p>
<p>In contrast to this, a closed question is fully contained. That is it presents a complete scenario and asks a specific question related to it. The easiest way for me to think about it is that a closed question ends with a question mark. Also, you will not have responses that are combinations of others responses. You know, A, C and D, but not B A and D, but not C or B, B and C only. That’s probably everything important about the questions. Now let’s get to the responses.</p>
<p>The list of possible responses include a correct answer and a number of incorrect answers. In the world of exam creation the correct answer is also called the key and incorrect answers are referred to as distractors. Distractors are incorrect within the context of the question, as you take AWS exams, you’ll find that while these options are incorrect, they are still plausible that is, there is some truth to them. They could even be true within another context.</p>
<p>Sometimes what makes a distractor plausible is a word or phrase that sounds as if it’s correct however, if you know the subject being tested it can be wrong to the point of being amusing. It’s like a honeypot, it will be attractive to those that are not fully knowledgeable. This is the type of question that will trap someone that fails to have the skills of a minimally qualified person.</p>
<p>There are two types of questions on the exam multiple choice and multiple response. Multiple choice questions have one correct response and three incorrect responses. Multiple response questions have two correct responses out of five possible options. These are the only types of questions on the exam. There are no true&#x2F;false, matching, drag and drop short answer or fill in the blank questions.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem strange to say out loud but to get a question correct you have to select the response or responses that best completes the statement or answers the question. The key word in that sentence is best. I’ve seen more than one question in AWS exams that had correct answers that were not close to how I would do things in the real world. If there’s a trick, it’s to recognize what’s possible and eliminate those answers that are impossible or absurd. For example, a question about updating a file stored in S3 requires you to understand that objects in S3 are immutable, they cannot be changed, only replaced. So a correct answer has to include the concept of creating a new object, anything else is wrong and can be eliminated.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked what happens if you skip a question and don’t answer it, unanswered questions and incorrect answers are scored the same, they’re incorrect there is no penalty for guessing. Regarding multiple response questions, they’re either 100% correct or they’re wrong there’s no partial credit. You can mark questions for review, when you finish the exam you’ll be prompted to review any questions you’ve marked. </p>
<p>The people responsible for creating the AWS certification exams work hard to ensure there are no teaching statements in the exam. That is there’s no language in exam questions that describes any AWS service or feature. If there was, it would be possible for one question to actually answer another one. For example, this is a teaching statement. Your organization is using AWS Lambda, a compute service that will let you run code without provisioning or managing servers. If another question on the same exam asked which service would you run code without provisioning or managing servers? People that don’t know the answer could still answer it correctly because the exam itself provided the answer.</p>
<p>I have never seen any teaching statements on the AWS exams I’ve taken, for this reason even though it’s possible to flag questions for later review, I don’t it’s rare that any given question has helped me answer another one even by triggering a memory. When I’m done, that’s it, I end the exam. When you’re done, you’ll be asked if you’re sure. It will prompt you, I think, three times before the exam is ended. You’ll be prompted, are you sure? Yes, I am, click. Then the exam will prompt you again, are you really sure? There’s no turning back. Yes, I’m sure, why are you torturing me? Click, it will then prompt, are you really, really sure? This is a nice exam you have here, it would be a shame if something bad happened to it. Yes, I’m sure, please stop taunting me I need this to be over, click.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe those aren’t the actual prompts it’s just how I felt after nearly every exam experience. After that third prompt, you might think that this is when you discover whether or not you’ve passed the exam, you’d be wrong. Then you’ll be given a survey. I’ve taken these exams for years and this part is the most annoying. I wanna know if I’ve passed however, the people at AWS want to know if I felt the exam was an accurate representation of my skills. The question I think, is impossible to know without knowing whether or not I passed. My feedback has been the same for years. However, the exam experience has not changed.</p>
