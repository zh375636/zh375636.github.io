<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course on Security and Compliance in AWS, where we’re here to help you on your journey to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Danny Jessee, and I am one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS – Amazon Web Services – and AWS certifications. In this course, the AWS team will be presenting a series of lectures that introduce some Security and Compliance services currently available in AWS that may be covered on the exam. Feel free to contact me with any questions using the details shown on the screen, or you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#97;&#x63;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#97;&#x63;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>, where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>This course has been specifically curated to help you pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and is ideal for anyone who is looking to learn more about the various Security and Compliance services in AWS in preparation for the exam. Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a great first step for anyone looking to grow within their current career, or transition to a new career entirely.</p>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide a high-level introduction to various Security and Compliance services in AWS and to introduce important security concepts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding compliance data with AWS Artifact;</li>
<li>Managing users, groups, and roles with AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM; and</li>
<li>Evaluating the security of your AWS environment using AWS Trusted Advisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also introduce the AWS Web Application Firewall, or WAF, which, along with other services such as the AWS Firewall Manager and AWS Shield, can help you create a comprehensive security solution for your web applications.</p>
<p>These objectives are covered by Domain 2 in the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam blueprint: Security and Compliance, which accounts for 25% of the exam content. The other courses in this learning path cover the remaining exam content and will ensure that you are fully prepared to sit this exam.</p>
<p>This course is designed for anyone who is new to cloud computing, so no prior experience with AWS is necessary. While it may be helpful to have a basic understanding of AWS and its services, as well as some exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation, and operations, this is not required as all of the concepts we will introduce in this course will be explained and reinforced from the ground up.</p>
<p>Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content current to provide the best training available.

Thank you!</p>
<h1 id="Finding-Compliance-Data-With-AWS-Artifact"><a href="#Finding-Compliance-Data-With-AWS-Artifact" class="headerlink" title="Finding Compliance Data With AWS Artifact"></a>Finding Compliance Data With AWS Artifact</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture where I will be examining AWS Artifact, a free self-service portal that provides you with immediate access to AWS security and compliance reports. Within AWS Artifact, you also have the ability to view, download, accept, and terminate legal agreements between you and AWS at both the account and organization level.</p>
<p>So you may be asking yourself: why would I ever need to access the information in AWS Artifact? And as it turns out, there could be several reasons. For starters, you might be asked to provide evidence of the current or historical compliance of different AWS services used within your architecture as part of a required audit to ensure that your enterprise may continue to leverage the AWS cloud. And this audit could potentially extend out to include your suppliers as well. Or perhaps you just want to learn more about your responsibilities when it comes to complying with various regulatory standards such as Payment Card Industry, or PCI, or Service Organization Control, or SOC. After all, simply leveraging the AWS cloud does not guarantee that the systems you build within it will be fully secure or compliant. We’ll discuss this more in a moment.</p>
<p>AWS Artifact can be accessed directly from the AWS console by searching “Artifact.” From there, the AWS Artifact home page gives you options to view reports and view agreements, so let’s spend a little time discussing reports and agreements in more detail.</p>
<p>AWS Artifact Reports consist of AWS auditor-issued reports and include everything from ISO certifications to PCI and SOC reports.</p>
<p>These reports, known as audit artifacts, may be shared with auditors and regulators by creating IAM users with an associated identity-based policy that grants access only to the necessary reports. And these audit artifacts allow you to provide evidence of AWS security controls to ensure compliance with any applicable governance, regulations, or frameworks when architecting solutions in the AWS cloud. Now of course this is always done in accordance with the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, where AWS is responsible for the underlying security OF the cloud, but you remain responsible for your own systems’ and applications’ security IN the cloud. Now to learn more about the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, I encourage you to check out this resource. Consequently, the compliance reports provided within AWS Artifact pertain only to AWS and do not in any way certify the security or compliance of your own company, organization, or application. However, these audit artifacts can and should inform the security controls you choose to implement as part of your own cloud architecture and solution design.</p>
<p>In addition to security and compliance reports, AWS Artifact also allows you to view and execute legally binding agreements between you and AWS.</p>
<p>These agreements can be applied at the individual account level, or if you are signed in to the AWS console with the management account of an organization in AWS Organizations, you can also apply an agreement to all member accounts within your organization. One example of a commonly used agreement is the AWS Business Associate Addendum, or BAA, which governs your use of AWS services when storing personal health information, or PHI.</p>
<p>To accept an agreement, you must first accept the AWS Artifact non-disclosure agreement or NDA.</p>
<p>After you have accepted this NDA, then downloaded and reviewed the agreement, you may accept the agreement by checking a box acknowledging that you accept all of its relevant terms and conditions. Note that when accepting an agreement on behalf of all member accounts within an AWS Organization, you must also certify that you have the full power and authority to accept the agreement on behalf of every entity that either currently has, or may ever subsequently have, a member account within your organization at any point in the future.</p>
<p>So that’s how we can use AWS Artifact to not only view compliance reports and agreements but also to help ensure the solutions we architect in the AWS cloud remain secure and compliant with all necessary rules and regulations.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Identity-and-Access-Management"><a href="#What-is-Identity-and-Access-Management" class="headerlink" title="What is Identity and Access Management?"></a>What is Identity and Access Management?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I shall provide an overview of what the Identity &amp; Access Management service is, and what IAM actually means.</p>
<p>Firstly I want to define what is meant by Identity &amp; Access Management and I shall break this down into two parts, starting with Identity Management. </p>
<p>Identities, such as AWS usernames are required to authenticate you to your AWS account, and this authentication process is managed in 2 stages.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first part of this process is to define who you are, effectively presenting your identity, so for example your AWS username. This identification is a unique value within IAM for your account, so this means IAM would prevent you from having 2 identical user accounts with the same name within the same AWS account.</li>
<li>The second part of the authentication process is to verify that you are who you say you are. This is achieved by supplying additional data, and when using our AWS usernames we can verify this by supplying a password</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Access Management relates to authorization and access control. Authorization determines what an identity can access within your AWS account once it’s been authenticated to it. An example of this authorization would be the user’s list of permissions to access specific AWS resources, for example, they might have Full Access to EC2 or Read Only to RDS.</p>
<p>Access Control can be classed as the mechanism of accessing a secured resource. For example, using the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username and password (Authentication and Verification)</li>
<li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA, used as an additional verification step following a valid password)</li>
<li>Or Federated Access, which allows users external to AWS to access resources securely without having to supply AWS user credentials from a valid IAM user account. Instead, these credentials are supplied from identity providers. For more information on Identity Federation, please see our existing course here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-aws-identity-federation-simplify-access-scale-1549/">https://cloudacademy.com/course/using-aws-identity-federation-simplify-access-scale-1549/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So essentially IAM can be defined by its ability to manage, control, and govern authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms of identities to your resources within your AWS Account.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of the different security controls from an authentication and authorization perspective can help you design the correct level of security for your infrastructure.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Features"><a href="#IAM-Features" class="headerlink" title="IAM Features"></a>IAM Features</h1><p>It’s critical to understand how IAM works and what can be achieved via the service, but it’s even more important to know how to implement its features. Without IAM, there would be no way of maintaining security or control of who or what could access your resources and what they could do with them, both internally and externally. IAM provides the components to maintain this management of access, but it is only as strong and secure as you configure it. </p>
<p>The responsibility of implementing secure, robust, and tight security within your AWS account using IAM is yours, you are the owner of the AWS account. You must define how secure your access control procedures must be, how much you want to restrict users from accessing certain resources, how complex a password policy must be, and if users should be using Multi-factor authentication. All of this is and much more is down to you to architect and implement, and much of it will likely depend on your own security standards and policies within your Information Security Management System (ISMS).</p>
<p>In this lecture, I want to talk about some of the different features and components that AWS IAM uses to centrally manage and control security permissions for any identity requiring access to your AWS Account and its resources. </p>
<p>From with the AWS Management Console, the IAM service can be found under the ‘Security, Identity &amp; Compliance’ category, and when accessed it will take you to the IAM Dashboard. </p>
<p>The initial dashboard of the IAM Console will display the following information.</p>
<p>This is a URL link that you can send to users who you will need to gain access to your AWS Management Console. This sign-in link can be customized by clicking on the ‘customize’ button to make it easier to remember and read. If you have multiple AWS accounts, this customization would help to distinguish between your accounts</p>
<p>IAM Resources. This section provides a summary overview of your IAM resources using a simple count of the number of users, user groups, roles, customer-managed policies, and identity providers you have configured within IAM. </p>
<p>Best Practices. This is populated with a list of IAM security best practices that AWS recommends you implement with links on how to implement them. I strongly recommend you try to adopt these best practices at your earliest opportunity. Maintaining tight security is paramount with working within a cloud environment.</p>
<p>In addition to this dashboard, you will also see 2 categories on the left menu, Access Management and Access Reports each listing a number of components underneath. I want to start by reviewing each of these components under Access Management to give you an insight into what each are used for, starting with Users.</p>
<p>User objects are created to represent an identity, this could be a real person within your organization who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment, or it could be an identity that is used by an application to interact with your AWS resources programmatically.  Users are simply objects representing an identity which are used in the authentication process to your AWS account. Being unique values, every user has an Amazon Resource Name, an ARN which it can be referenced by. An example of a user’s ARN could be as shown.</p>
<p>When configuring your Users you can set them up for Multi-Factor Authentication. Configuring MFA allows for an additional level of verification to be applied, the user will have to enter a random 6 digit number from a linked MFA device after their usual password. MFA should be used for the AWS Account owner and any other users who have elevated privileges. </p>
<p>IAM USer Groups are objects much like user objects, however, they are not used in any authentication process, instead, they are used to authorize members of the group access to AWS resources.</p>
<p>So, the IAM USer Groups contain IAM Users, and these groups have IAM policies associated that will either allow or explicitly deny access to AWS resources. These policies are either pre-existing AWS Managed policies, customer-managed policies that are created by you, the customer, or in-line policies which are embedded explicitly to the group itself.</p>
<p>IAM Roles allow Users, other AWS services, and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM permissions to access AWS resources. Roles essentially operate the same as User objects do in that it’s an identity with associated permissions to allow it access to different resources. The difference being however is that roles don’t define a single person, they are designed to be assumed by any identity or service that needs to temporarily acquire a set of permissions. Additionally, roles don’t have passwords associated with their identities, instead, like I just mentioned, roles are assumed as long as you have the correct permissions to assume it.</p>
<p>Policies used within IAM are written as JSON documents and these define what can and can’t be accessed. These policies can be attached to Users, User Groups, or Roles. </p>
<p>When working with policies, you can use Managed policies or In-line policies. Managed policies are viewed as a library of usable policies and come in 2 different flavors which can be applied to multiple Users, User Groups, and Roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS Managed Policies: These are a list of predefined policies granting varied access to different AWS services</li>
<li>Customer Managed Policies: These are policies created and written by you as the customer</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike Managed policies, Inline policies are not stored in a library, instead, they have to be written and explicitly embedded within a User, User Group, or Role, as a result, the same policy can’t easily be applied to another identity like Managed policies can.</p>
<p>If you are looking to provide federated access to your AWS resources, then you must add an identity provider. </p>
<p>Federated Access allows credentials external to AWS to be used as a means of authentication to your AWS resources. For example, you could establish a trust between your Active Directory Federation server on premises and your AWS account. Or, you could establish a trust between your AWS account and Google account. Either way, in these instances your ADFS server or Google account could be configured as Identity Providers allowing those authenticated by Active Directory or Google to access your resources in your AWS account. This prevents you from having to create individual IAM user accounts.</p>
<p>Under Account Settings, you can enforce a password policy, and it’s always best practice to do so. The Password policy should be used to enforce the minimum security requirements that need to be met for any password standards that your organization might have to adhere to. The password policy applies to all IAM users within your account, and as you can see here, you can be very specific by enabling&#x2F;disabling and configuring different controls.</p>
<p>The STS service is used to allow you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for both IAM users and federated users. The STS endpoints provide a list of Regions that are either activated or deactivated for STS. By default, all Regions are activated, however, it is recommended you deactivate the regions you do not intend to use. </p>
<p>By default STS uses the global endpoint of  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sts.amazonaws.com/">https://sts.amazonaws.com</a>, however, when using regional endpoints it can help to reduce latency.</p>
<p>So that has given a quick overview of the component covered by Access Management, I now want to look at the features that come under the category of Access Reports, starting with Access Analyzer</p>
<p>Access Analyzer. This is used to generate findings when a policy on a resource within your zone of trust allows access from outside your zone of trust. So this could be from a number of different sources, such as an IAM role allowing cross-account access, or a Bucket that allows a different account to upload objects into the bucket, basically any resource that allows external access to your resources will be flagged and highlighted to ensure you are aware of the access. This is a great tool to help reduce security risks and threats as you or your team may have unintentionally allowed access to a resource you shouldn’t have. Any issues are recorded by Access Analyzer as a finding allowing you to review the access </p>
<p>The credential report is a great tool that allows you to generate and download a *.csv file containing a list of all of your IAM users and their credentials. This provides a quick and easy way to review your accounts and the last time they were used, in addition to identifying when a user’s password was last changed and if they have Multi-Factor Authentication enabled.</p>
<p>If using AWS Organizations, it allows you to Select an organizational unit (OU) or account to view its service activity over the previous 365 days. By drilling down into the accounts in this section you can see which users have had activity, in addition to which AWS services they have accessed over a given time frame. </p>
<p>Service Control Policies. This links in with the previous component, ‘Organization Activity’, and lists any Service Control Policies that are applicable to the account and the number of identities affected. Service Control Policies, or SCPs, are different from identity-based policies which grant permissions to users, user groups, and roles as SCPs do not actually grant permission themselves. Instead, SCPs are used with AWS Organizations to implement and set a boundary of permissions for AWS accounts. </p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS, and EC2 via an identity-based policy in IAM. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2, despite having full access to S3. The SCP would prevent that service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<h1 id="Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard"><a href="#Overview-of-the-User-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="Overview of the User Dashboard"></a>Overview of the User Dashboard</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I’m going to review the dashboard of the user Console. In IAM, we can create user objects to represent an identity with long-term credentials, this could be a real person within your organization who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment, or it could be an account to be used by an application that may require permissions to access your AWS resources programmatically. Users are simply objects representing an identity which are used to authenticate to your AWS account with an associated set of permissions.</p>
<p>When you open the AWS IAM dashboard and select users, you will be presented with a screen similar to the following. This screen provides a summary of the key points of interest relating to your IAM users and it can quickly help you identify any potential security risks that you might encounter. As we can see, we have a number of different warnings on this screen in different colors. We have a green tick which symbolizes activity was measured within the last 90 days An amber exclamation mark showing activity was last measured between 91 and 365 days ago. And a red exclamation mark, which highlight anything older than 365 days ago. Anything either amber or red should be looked at and addressed as a priority to reduce potential security issues.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at this table and its columns to understand exactly what it’s trying to show you. The complete list of field names are shown here, and you can toggle them on an off as you need. Let me go through each of them one-by-one to explain what they represent. So username. This column is self-explanatory, it provides the username of that user.</p>
<p>Path. If you create your users using the IAM API or the AWS Command Line Interface, the CLI, then you can specify a path structure for your users. This is useful when you have a large organization and you want to define a management structure to help you organize your users more effectively.</p>
<p>For example, you could add a path for a user Stuart of &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Stuart. This would help to define where your users might be in accordance with your organization structure. In addition to this, you can also reference paths in your access policies, so for example you could allow all users in the &#x2F;ContentTeam&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;UK&#x2F; path to have full access to S3 with a simple policy like this.</p>
<p>Groups. This shows the different groups that the user belongs to. In the screenshot, you can see that the user Stuart belongs to the Admin group. Last activity. This column is really useful to show the last time your users logged into the AWS Management Console or if they accessed any of your AWS resources programmatically using their access keys. As we can see from my example, the user Alice hasn’t accessed anything for 467 days, as a result I can say with some confidence that this user can be removed and deleted from IAM. So it’s a great way to ensure that you don’t have any unused user accounts, and deleting unused accounts is an IAM best practice.</p>
<p>MFA. MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, and so this will highlight any users that have been configured with MFA which adds an additional level of verification, enhancing security. The users in my example that show virtual mean that these users are using MFA on a virtual device, and in this example it’s the Google Authenticator app on a mobile phone. For those unfamiliar with MFA, let me give a brief explanation of what it is. Typically, when a user logs into the AWS Management Console, they will authenticate to your AWS account by providing their identification, typically their username, and then verify this identification, usually with a password. These two elements, the identification and verification, allow the user to authenticate. For many cases, the verification, the password, is sufficient enough to confirm the identity, the username. However, for users who have an elevated level of privileges, for example the users may have full access to a large number of AWS services, then you may want to, or be required to due to governance controls, implement an additional verification step within the authentication process. This adds another layer of security attached to the identity, and this is where Multi-Factor Authentication comes in, MFA. The name explains itself, it’s used to create an additional factor for authentication in addition to your existing methods, such as a password. Therefore creating a multi-factor level of authentication. So what is this additional level of security that MFA brings with AWS? MFA utilizes a random six-digit number that is only available for a very short time period before the number changes again which is generated by an MFA device. There is no additional charge for this level of authentication, however, you will need your own MFA device, which can be a physical token or a virtual device. AWS provides a summary of all supported devices here. Personally, I use Google Authenticator on my phone because it is simple and easy to set up and configure. Password age. This shows how long ago it was until the password of the user was changed. As a security best practice, your passwords should be changed regularly.</p>
<p>Console last sign-in. This column simply shows the last time a user signed in to the management console.</p>
<p>Access key ID. The access key ID will identify if it’s active or inactive and will display the key in use. Before I continue, let me just quickly explain a little more about Access Keys. Access Keys are used for programmatic access to your AWS resources, and they are comprised of two elements. An access key ID and a Secret Access Key ID The Access Key ID is made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters, such as the one shown here. The Secret Access Key ID is made up of 40 random upper and lowercase alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters, such as the one displayed on the screen. During the creation of a user who requires programmatic access, you are prompted to download and save these details and it’ll only be displayed once, and if you lose it, then you will have to delete the associated Access Key ID and recreate new keys for the user. It’s not possible to retrieve lost Secret Access Key IDs as AWS does not retain copies. These access keys must then be applied and associated with the application that you are using that requires the relevant access. For example, if you were using the AWS CLI to access AWS resources, you would first have to instruct the AWS CLI to use these Access Keys to authenticate you providing authorization. The method of performing this association varies based on the application and system that you are using. However, once this association has taken place it ensures that all API requests made to AWS are signed with this digital signature.</p>
<p>Active key age. The active key age refers to the age of the access keys that are associated with the user which, as I explained, are required for programmatic access. Access key last used. This column just shows the last time that the user used their Access Keys within your AWS account. As a security best practice, it’s a good idea to remove any access keys that haven’t been used for quite some time. This removes possible entry points for malicious users to gain access to your environment.</p>
<p>The ARN. The ARN, or Amazon Resource Name provides the unique identifier for referencing that particular user. For example, the one showne here for the user Stuart. Creation time. This is a simple time metric to show you how long ago the user was created Console access. The console access helps you to determine which users have access to the Management console. When creating a new user, you have the option to configure their access type as seen here. Each user can be configured to have Programmatic Access, or AWS Management Console Access, or both. If they have access to the Console, then this column will show as Enabled for the user and Disabled if the user does not have console access.</p>
<p>Signing certs. Finally, the last column of signing certs will show if the user has a Signing Certificate or X.509 Certificate associated with them for secure access to certain AWS product interfaces. For example, EC2 uses a Signing Certificate for access to its SOAP, Simple Object Access Protocol, and command line utilities. Finally, before we finish this lecture, you can also create and delete users as required, and search for any of your users via their username or access key from within the user dashboard.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-IAM-Users"><a href="#Creating-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Creating IAM Users"></a>Creating IAM Users</h1><p>When creating a new user, you have the option to create it via the AWS Management Console or programmatically via the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or using the IAM HTTP API. For this lecture, I should be using the AWS Management Console to demonstrate how to configure Users. User object creation is a simple process. Firstly, you will set the user details by creating a username, which can be up to 64 characters in length. Next you’ll select the AWS access type, either AWS Management Console access or programmatic access.</p>
<p>For programmatic access, an access key ID and secret access key ID will be issued to be used with the AWS CLI, SDKs or other development tools. If console access is required, you will need to define a console password for the user. Permission assignment through the use of policies can be attached to the user or inherited from a group that the user can be assigned to. And permission boundaries can also be applied to the user, controlling their maximum permission level. You can assign any tags to the user as you would with any other AWS resource. And then you must review and confirm the information that has been submitted before you create the user.</p>
<p>Once the user is created, you can download the security credentials via a CSV file. And that will contain the username, access keys required for programmatic access and the console login link. So let me now jump into the console to demonstrate how to create a new user. Okay, so I’ve just logged into my AWS Management Console. And the first thing I want to do is to go to IAM. And that can be found under the Security, Identity and Compliance category.</p>
<p>So if we select IAM, and that will take us straight to the IAM dashboard. And this is where we can start creating our users and groups and roles, et cetera, and anything else that we need to manage within IAM. So to create a new user, I need to go across to Users on the left here. And then from here, I can select Add users.</p>
<p>Now the first thing I need to do is to create the username of the user. So I’m going to call this user Patricia. And then we can select the access types. So we have the programmatic access here, all the AWS Management Console access here. So for this user, let me add both. So I want them to have programmatic access and also AWS Management Console access. So I’m going to select both. So for the AWS Management Console access, we need to enable a password so we can either have IAM auto-generated password or I can select my own. And for this demonstration, I’m going to add in my own password.</p>
<p>Now if you tick this option here, when the user signs in, they will be asked to generate their own password once they’ve used your initial password to login. And that’s a great idea, just to enhance security there. So if we click on Next, then we can assign permissions. And here we have a couple of options so we can add the user to an existing group. We can copy permissions from another user or attach existing policies directly to the user. So for best practice, I’m just going to add this user to a couple of different groups. So I’m gonna add them to the CloudAcademy group, and also to the RDSFullAccess.</p>
<p>So once you’ve selected the groups that you want the user to have, you can click on Next to go to tags. And this is an optional step. You can add any key value tags here for that user if you want to. Just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Then if we go to Next to Review, then we can review all the options that we’ve set. So we’ve given the username. We specify the access types. So you’ve got programmatic and AWS Management Console access. We’ve not set any permission boundaries. We’ve added the groups that we want the user to belong to and we haven’t applied any tags.</p>
<p>So now, we can go to Create User. Now we’ve successfully created the IAM user, but because we specified that we wanted programmatic access, we need to copy the access key ID and also the secret access key ID as well. If we download the CSV file of that user and take a look at that, we can see here that this CSV file shows the access key ID and also the secret access key ID, and also the console link as well to allow that user to login. So if we go back to the AWS Console, we can also email those login instructions to the user as well if we need to. Once you’ve taken a copy of the access key ID and the secret access key, then you can close this window. Remember, you will only be given one opportunity to take these details and download the CSV that contains that information, so make sure you do that. Then click on Close. And we can now see that that user, Patricia, has been set up as a user with the CloudAcademy and RDSFullAccess groups. So it’s very simple. It’s very quick. It’s very easy to set up a new user within IAM.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-IAM-Users"><a href="#Managing-IAM-Users" class="headerlink" title="Managing IAM Users"></a>Managing IAM Users</h1><p>Once you have created IAM users, you can view their details to configure additional security options or review permissions and change access. In this lecture, I want to cover these additional features. This will be easiest to explain via a demonstration, and I can explain each point as we go through, so let’s take a look. So in this demonstration, I just want to select a user and just to show you some of the different elements that you can change of that user once it has been created, so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>So I’m in the Identity and Access Management Dashboard at the moment and you can see I’m in the Users section. So let’s take a look at this user, Patricia. So if I select the user and we can have a look at some of the options that we can see about this user and some of the things that we can change, et cetera. So this is a summary screen of the user. We have the users ARN at the top here, and we can also see the creation time of that user. And then we have a number of different tabs.</p>
<p>So start with the permissions tab. We can see that this user is getting permissions from two policies at the moment here, the Amazon S3 Full Access policy, and also the Amazon RDS Full Access. And if we wanted to, we can just take a quick look at these groups. We can have a look at the policy summary, or we can take a look at the JSON as well. So that’s the policy and the JSON format. And then if we look at the policy summary, we can see here that this allows full access to S3 and S3 Object Lambda. Here we can set her permissions boundary. Currently there’s not one set, but if we wanted to, we can set one to control the maximum permissions that this user can have. And also there’s a feature here to generate policy based on CloudTrail events.</p>
<p>So what this will do, it will generate a policy looking at the user’s activity. And then based on what the user has been accessing, it can generate a policy based on what services this user has been accessing. Also at the top here, we can add an inline policy for this user. So if we’d done that, then that will be a policy that is embedded within the user object itself. So it’s not taken from a role, it’s not taken from a group. The policy is attached within the user.</p>
<p>Okay, if we take a look at the groups, we can just see a quick breakdown of any groups that the user belongs to, and the policies that are attached to them, which we covered just a moment ago in the summary. The tags is what you’d expect. If there’s any tags here for the user, then they would be listed, or if you wanted to add any tags, then you can do so here. So for example, we can add a key of location and say, UK, Save Changes. And then we can see this tag for this user. Under security credentials, we could see console link that this user can use and we can manage the user’s password. And if we want to change the password, we can simply click on manage, and we can either disable the console access or generate a new password, or ask the user to create a new password at the next sign-in. We also have here, the assigned MFA device, the multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s not assigned, but we can go ahead and set up MFA for this user. So let’s go ahead and do that quickly. So if we click on manage, we have a couple of options here, virtual MFA device, U2F security key, or another hardware MFA device. For this, I’m just going to use a virtual MFA device and I’ll use the Google Authenticator app on my phone to do this. If I click on continue. So, first of all, you need to make sure you have an app on your mobile phone or your computer. Like I say, I’m going to use the Google Authenticator app on my phone.</p>
<p>So what I need to do is to show the QR code, and now on my phone, I’m going to add this as a new entry in my Google Authenticator app, so I’m going to click on Scan QR code. And then we can see at the bottom there is added the user, Patricia. And then we add in that code, so 074720. And then what we need to do is to add the second code that comes in when it appears on the Google Authenticator app. So we’re just waiting for that to come around and then I can add in the second code and then it’ll be synchronized and configured. So, we can see it’s about to change, and now I can add in the next code 185887, and then I click on Assign MFA. And that’s it, so you have successfully assigned a virtual MFA device to that user. Click on Close, and there we can see here that there’s an assigned MFI device. We can see that this user also had programmatic access ‘cause there’s access keys that have been generated.</p>
<p>Now, if we wanted to, we can make this access key ID inactive. So if wanted to do that, simply click on Make inactive. And it’ll explained that once you’ve done this, you can’t then use these keys to form any programmatic access. Click on deactivate. And you can see here, the status is now inactive. So any access keys that were used before for this user will no longer be allowed to make any kind of requests. If we wanted to generate new access keys, simply click on Create access key. And again, you’ll have a new access key ID and a new secret access key. And if you wanted to, you can download the CSV file, so you don’t forget those keys. Click on Close.</p>
<p>Now, if we go back up to the top to Access Advisor, I just wanted to show you this quickly. So what this does, it will basically show you which services that this user can access based on their current permissions, and also the last time that these services were accessed. So if you scroll down here, we can see that this user has access to a whole different range of services. And it’ll show you which policies are actually granting these permissions.</p>
<p>So this access to EC2 in IAM is being granted through the RDS Full Access policy, and access to S3 is being granted through the Amazon S3 Full Access. So this is great to review to identify if there’s any users there that do have access to services that they probably shouldn’t do. So you can then modify the policies accordingly just to make sure that the users are only accessing what they are supposed to access. So that was a very quick demonstration of some of the key points that you can change within a user’s properties once you have created an IAM user.</p>
<h1 id="Managing-Multiple-Users-with-IAM-User-Groups"><a href="#Managing-Multiple-Users-with-IAM-User-Groups" class="headerlink" title="Managing Multiple Users with IAM User Groups"></a>Managing Multiple Users with IAM User Groups</h1><p>In this lecture, I want to talk about how IAM User Groups can be used to manage multiple users. IAM User Groups do not signify a single user and they can’t be referenced as a principal in any AWS access policy like a User or a Role can. However, they are used to authorize access for members of the group to AWS resources through the use of AWS Policies attached to the User Groups. So User Groups are objects that contain IAM Users, and these User Groups will have IAM policies associated that will allow or explicitly deny access to AWS resources.</p>
<p>These policies can be AWS Managed policies that can be selected from within IAM, customer-managed policies that are created by you, or in-line policies, which are written and embedded directly into the group. User Groups are a great user management feature and they are normally created to directly relate to a specific requirement or job role. For example, you could have a group called Developers, and then attach policies to that group that allow access to AWS resources required by your development team.</p>
<p>Any users that are then a member of that group will automatically inherit the permissions applied to the group. By applying permissions to a group instead of individual users, it makes it easy to modify permissions for multiple users at once, simplifying access management at scale. It’s a security best practice to apply permissions to User Groups and then associate users to that group than to associate policies to individual Users. This prevents you having to update permissions for each and every user.</p>
<p>For example, if you needed to change access for all the individual developers that had policies assigned to them directly, and this can be very time intensive and prone to human error, especially in an enterprise environment. If using groups and additional access is required for your Developer User Group, all you would need to do is to modify the permissions of the Developer Group and all your associated developers would inherit the new access.</p>
<p>Creating a group is very simple and is essentially a three-step process. You must give your group a meaningful name, add users to the group, attach permissions via the policies. Once you have created a user group, you can then review its configuration, edit the permissions and see other details such as the ARN of the user group. Let me show you via a quick demonstration on how to create an IAM group and then how to modify the permissions of the group once it’s been created.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS Management Console and I’ve gone to the IAM dashboard. Now, from here, to access and create groups, under access management on the left, you can see user groups. So if you select that, and then will show you any groups that you currently have. And I only have one group, which is Admin. So to create a new group, you’ve gotta cross to the right-hand side here, click on create group. And the first thing you need to do is to give the group a name. So I’m going to call this MyS3andEC2Group. And then after that, you need to select the users that you want to be a part of the group.</p>
<p>So if you already have the IAM users there, you can add them at this stage. So let’s just go ahead and add in Stuart. And then at the bottom, you can then attach any policies that you want to be associated with the group. So if I type in S3, and it’ll pick up any policies that we have associated with S3. And I’m going to select this one here, this AmazonS3andEC2FullAccess policy. And if I click on the little plus sign here, it’ll give you a JSON view of the actual policy itself. So you can see exactly what’s happening.</p>
<p>So now I’ve selected that policy. If we just go down to create group at the bottom, and it’s as simple as that. So it’s very easy to create a group. You simple give it a name, specify the users if you need to at that stage and also add any permissions if you want to at that stage as well.</p>
<p>Now, once we’ve created our group, if we select it, we can see the user list here. Now, if you need to add any additional users, simply click on add users, select the users that you’d like and click on add users. And then they’ll be immediately added to the group. You can also look at the permissions. So here’s the policy that we added. Now, we can if we want to, add additional permissions by clicking on this button here. And you can either attach an existing policy or create an inline policy that’s directly embedded into the group.</p>
<p>So for example, if we go to attach policies, and we want RDS access as well for the people in this group, have a quick search and we’ll select this AWS managed policy for RDSFullAccess. Click on add permissions. And we can now see that this group has two permissions policies. And again, we can view the JSON details of those policies if we want to. And then we have the Amazon RDS policy here. So it’s very easy to set up groups and only literally takes just a few clicks.</p>
<p>So that’s how you create a new group, add users and also change the permissions as well. And also, just before we finish, if you want to delete the group, you can click on delete here. And we just need to type in the name of the group to confirm the deletion. So I’ll just go ahead and do that. Then click on delete. And that deletes the group. Finally, from a limitation perspective, your AWS account has a default maximum limit of 300 groups. To increase this you’ll need to contact AWS using the appropriate limit increase forms. Also, a user can only be associated with 10 groups, so bear this in mind when assigning permissions and each group can contain 10 different policies attached at once. Limitations on AWS services is fluctuating all of the time, so for the latest information on Group limitations, please see the following URL here.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-Roles"><a href="#IAM-Roles" class="headerlink" title="IAM Roles"></a>IAM Roles</h1><p>IAM Roles allow trusted Users, AWS services and applications to adopt a set of temporary IAM credentials to access your AWS resources. Roles act as identities, much like Users do, and have permissions assigned to them defining what resources the Roles can and can’t access. Unlike Users though, which represent a single identity, IAM Roles are designed to be assumed by multiple different entities as and when required. Like I say, Roles are used for temporary access to gain access to resources, and each time the role is assumed by a User, an AWS service or an application, a new set of credentials is dynamically created for the duration of that session. As a result, Roles do not have any long term credentials associated, so there is no password for console access, nor are there any access keys for programmatic access that are explicitly associated with the Role.</p>
<p>For every role there will be associated policies controlling access as to what can and can’t be accessed when the role is assumed. There will also be a Trust Relationship, and this Trust Relationship defined who or what can assume the role, for example a User, an AWS account, or an AWS Service. IAM Roles are generally used: if you need to grant temporary access for Users to AWS resources that they don’t normally require access to or you can use a Role to grant access for an IAM user in one account to access resources in another AWS account or perhaps an AWS service needs to access resources on your behalf or if an application requires access to resources you can use a Role instead of embedding credentials into the software itself. Or you might have federated users who require access to specific resources, perhaps those authenticated via Active Directory So, as a result, Roles can be assumed by the following: A user that’s in the same AWS account as the where the role has been created, a user that’s in a different AWS account than where the the role has been created, an AWS service, such as EC2, or an external federated users to your AWS account</p>
<h1 id="Using-AWS-Service-Roles-to-Access-AWS-Resources-on-Your-Behalf"><a href="#Using-AWS-Service-Roles-to-Access-AWS-Resources-on-Your-Behalf" class="headerlink" title="Using AWS Service Roles to Access AWS Resources on Your Behalf"></a>Using AWS Service Roles to Access AWS Resources on Your Behalf</h1><p>An AWS Service Role allows an AWS service to assume a role to access other AWS resources within your own account on your behalf. This is commonly used for EC2 instances, whereby you could create a role for an EC2 instance to assume to gain access to AWS resources on your behalf. Let’s look at an example of when you might use this.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario. You have an EC2 instance running an application that requires access to Amazon S3 to Put and Get objects using the relevant API calls. To allow access to S3, a set of credentials could be stored on the EC2 instance within the application code allowing it to use those credentials to gain access to the relevant S3 Bucket for any Put or Get API requests. However, in this scenario, you would need to manage these credentials manually including the rotation of access keys, which is obviously an administrative burden and open to the possibility of being compromised by a malicious attacker.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue, the EC2 instance could be assigned an IAM Role, which in turn would have the relevant permissions associated granting the EC2 instance and its application to access S3 to perform the Put and Get API calls using existing AWS managed or customer manager policies. EC2 instances can be assigned a role during its creation, or to a running instance. You can also replace a role that is already associated with an EC2 instance with a new role. From a security best practice perspective you should always associate a Role to an EC2 instance for accessing AWS resources instead of storing local credentials on the instance itself.</p>
<p>There is also another great advantage of using Service Roles. Let’s now imagine we have a fleet of EC2 instances all using the same application and performing the same task using the same role, but now consider that your existing application, which was used to perform Put and Get requests is now only required to perform Put requests only, and Get requests must be denied.</p>
<p>To make the change, all you’d to do is to alter the permissions assigned to the IAM Role and all EC2 instances associated with that Role would now have the correct permissions. If this same scenario happened by embedding credentials locally on the EC2 instance, then it would take a long time to replicate the change on every instance accurately.</p>
<p>When creating a Service Role, there’s a number of AWS Services that integrate with IAM that support roles. This is a screenshot at the time of writing this course showing the supported AWS services, but for the latest information, you should always check the AWS documentation found here. Before we move on from AWS Service Roles, I want to mention service-linked roles.</p>
<p>A number of different AWS services require roles to perform functions requiring very specific permissions, and in these instances AWS allows you to create service-linked Roles. These are often created the first time that you use a service. Service-linked Roles come pre-configured with the relevant AWS Managed policies, trusts and permissions allowing only that Service to carry out the required operations with other AWS resources that it needs to interact with. Some examples of these roles include AWS ServiceRoleForAmazonSSM.</p>
<p>So AWS Systems Manager uses this IAM service role to manage AWS resources on your behalf. AWS ServiceRoleForCloudTrail. So this service linked role is used for supporting the organization trail feature with AWS CloudTrail. And AWS ServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents. CloudWatch uses this service-linked role to perform Amazon EC2 alarm actions.</p>
<p>So if we look closer at the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM in IAM, we will find that the trusted identity to use this role is ssm.amazonaws.com, AWS Systems Manager. and with it having an AWS Managed policy already configured, we’re unable to edit and update this policy. This policy is specifically designed to provide access to AWS Resources managed or used by Amazon SSM, and this role is created when you configure SSM. So the difference between AWS Service and AWS Service-Linked Roles is that AWS Service roles allow you to apply your own customer managed or AWS Managed policies, whereas service-linked roles come pre-configured with a specific set of read-only AWS managed policies that can only be used by that particular service.</p>
<h1 id="Using-IAM-User-Roles-to-Grant-Temporary-Access-for-Users"><a href="#Using-IAM-User-Roles-to-Grant-Temporary-Access-for-Users" class="headerlink" title="Using IAM User Roles to Grant Temporary Access for Users"></a>Using IAM User Roles to Grant Temporary Access for Users</h1><p>There might be circumstances where you will need to grant temporary access to AWS resources for a particular user and the best way to do this would be to allow the user to assume a role with these new permissions. The alternative would be to either add a policy associated with the user and then remember to remove the policy again afterwards, which would likely lead to a security risk, and as we know, attaching policies to a specific user isn’t considered a security best practice, we should use user groups instead. However, if we added these permissions to a user group that the user belonged to, then all users that are a part of that same user group would receive those permissions, so that’s definitely a security risk.</p>
<p>So in this instance, creating a new role with the relevant permissions and allowing only specific users to assume that role, is the best approach to the problem. When a user assumes a role, it replaces all other permissions that the user has. You might think that the user keeps their current permissions and just inherits the additional permissions set out by the role, but that’s not the case. When you assume a role, your existing permissions are temporarily replaced.</p>
<p>I mentioned previously that every role has a trust relationship and so as a user, you can only assume roles where they have been added as a trusted entity. However, in addition to being trusted, the user also has to have the relevant permissions to assume the role as well and this is done via an access policy.</p>
<p>So let’s assume we have a role called RoleS3FullAccess with a permission policy attached as shown which grants full access to Amazon S3. And the trusted entity of this role was defined as the user specified in this ARN. So this means this role trusts the user, Stuart, to assume the role to gain full access to S3. However, Stuart’s permissions do not currently allow him to assume this role. For Stuart to be able to assume the RoleS3FullAcess role, Stuart will need to have the following policy associated with his user, where the text in red is the ARN of the role. When this policy is associated with Stuart, he then has permission to assume the role which is trusted to him as defined in the trusted entity section of the role allowing him to have full access to S3.</p>
<p>Let me now provide a demonstration on how you could create this example that we just ran through. Okay, so I’m in my AWS Management Console and I’m at the IAM dashboard. So in this demonstration, we’re going to create a role with a policy attached and then add an inline policy to the user, Stuart, to ensure that Stuart can assume the role.</p>
<p>So firstly, let’s create our role. So on the left here, we have roles and then over in the top right, we have Create Role. So because we want this role to assumed by a user, we have to pick the correct type of trusted entity. So it’s not going to be assumed by an AWS Service and it’s not to with Federation either, so the option we need here, is this one relating to an AWS account. Now although says another AWS account, this option is used to creating cross-account access, but you can also create roles to be assumed by users within your own account as well. And to do that, all we need to do in the account ID, is to enter our our account ID, so if I just add that in there, and you can also add a couple of additional options, such as requiring multifactor authentication, et cetera.</p>
<p>So once we’ve put in the account ID of where the users are that we want to assume this role, we can then click on next, permissions. And I want the policy that’s attached to this role to have full S3 access, so let’s have a quick search. And here we have it here, Amazon S3 full access, which is an AWS managed policy. Then click on next for tags. Add any tags in that you’d like for the role as an optional step. I’m just gonna leave it blank for this demonstration. And this is where we can give the role a name, so I’m going to call this RoleS3FullAccess. Give it a description if you need to and here we have the trusted entity, which is my own account and then all we need to do from there, is click on Create Role.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we search for that. RoleS3, here we have our role here. So if we go into the role, we can have a look at our trust relationships, so this is essentially saying that anyone within this account is trusted to assume this role and we can also edit this trust relationship as well. So this shows the policy that relates to that trust relationship. So this essentially allows anyone in this account, access to the role, as long as they have that assume role permissions that we’ll be looking at in just a moment. But I want to make this a bit more secure, so I’m going to change it from root to user, Stuart.</p>
<p>So now the trusted relationship for this role will only allow the user, Stuart, within this account to assume the role, given the correct permissions. So I’m gonna update that trust policy and now we can see the trusted entity has been changed. And if we take a look at the permissions, we can see that it has the policy attached there as well. So now we’ve got roles set up with the correct permissions, we now need to edit the user, Stuart with an inline policy to allow that user to assume the role. So I’ve just gone with IAM user of Stuart. If we click on add inline policy and go across to JSON.</p>
<p>Now, here I’m just going to paste in a policy that I’ve already created. So will allow the user, Stuart to use the secure token service AssumeRole action against the role that we just created and that’s the ARN in the role. So now Stuart will have access to assume that role. Let’s go to review policy. Give this a name. I’m just going to call this, AssumeRoleS3. Create policy. And there we have the inline policy that we just created, attached to the user, Stuart.</p>
<p>So now what I want to do, is to log in as the user, Stuart and show you how I can switch to this role. Okay, so I’ve now signed in as the user, Stuart and to switch roles, all I need to do, is to select on the top right up there, select Switch Role. And again, Switch Role. Type in the account. So I’ll just paste that in quickly and then type the role name, which we called RoleS3FullAccess and then click on Switch Role. And that’s it, we’ve now switched roles and if you look in the top right, we can see that it says, RoleS3FullAccess at this account number and that signifies that you swapped your permissions for that role that the user, Stuart has just assumed.</p>
<p>Once you finish what you need to do with the permissions given by the role, you can simply select the top right area again and say Switch Back. And that will revert you back to your original user with your original permissions. IAM user roles are often used to create a cross-account access role, allowing users in one AWS account to access resources in a different AWS account. For a full explanation on how to create cross-account roles, please see our existing course found here.</p>
<h1 id="Using-Roles-for-Federated-Access"><a href="#Using-Roles-for-Federated-Access" class="headerlink" title="Using Roles for Federated Access"></a>Using Roles for Federated Access</h1><p>In this lecture, I want to discuss how users who have been federated can access your resources using roles. When doing so you have two options. Firstly, Web Identity, this allows users federated by a specified external web identity or OpenID Connect provider, to assume this Role to perform actions in your account. And secondly, SAML 2.0 federation, this allows users that are federated with SAML 2.0, to assume this Role to perform actions in your account.</p>
<p>So let’s first look at Web Identity and a scenario where you might need to create a Role. You’ve just created a new mobile application that requires access to Amazon S3 to store media such as photos and videos from users worldwide. As a part of the operations of your application, it will require permissions to S3, to upload and download this media from tens of thousands of users. Embedding long-term credentials into your application code to do this goes against all security best practices. And so instead, you should design your application to request temporary credentials from authenticated users through web identity federation. </p>
<p>Before I go any further, let me explain what identity federation is. It’s basically a method of authentication where two different providers can establish a level of trust, allowing users to authenticate from one, which authorizes them to access resources in the other. During the federation process, one party would act as an Identity Provider, known as an IdP, and the other would be the service provider, an SP. The identity provider authenticates the user and the service provider controls access to their service or resources based on the IdP’s authentication.</p>
<p>You’ve probably all been to websites where it presents you with a login page, where you can either login using existing credentials, native that service, or you might have an option to authenticate using credentials from a third party provider, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, or LinkedIn, et cetera. So going back to our example, our application run on AWS would be the service provider, and the Web Identity provider could be Google or Facebook, for example.</p>
<p>So when users authenticate to your app via web identity federation, they will receive an authentication token. This token is then exchanged for temporary security credentials in AWS, which can be mapped to your IAM Role, using the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API. This then allows the relevant access to Amazon S3 provided by the role, to carry out the operations needed by the application.</p>
<p>Generally, when working with mobile applications, the preferred and recommended method for managing access, would be via Amazon Cognito, to manage his federation process. For more information related to Amazon Cognito, please see our existing course here.</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at SAML 2.0 federation. Whereas web identity federation is generally used for large, wide scale of access from unknown users, SAML 2.0 is generally used to authenticate your employees using existing directory services that you might already be using. SAML, which stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, is a standard that’s used to exchange authentication and authorization identities between different security domains, which uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a user between a SAML Identity Provider and a SAML consumer.</p>
<p>For example, you might already to be using Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate your employees to your internal network. And so you might not want to or need to create lots of users in IAM with their own set of credentials. Instead, it would be easier to allow them to federate their access through via SAML, integrating with your ADFS server. The benefits of this are twofold. It minimizes the amount of administration required within IAM and it allows for a single sign on solution.</p>
<p>As the vast majority of organizations today are using Microsoft Active Directory, using MSAD is an effective way of granting access to your AWS resources without going through the additional burden of creating potentially hundreds of IAM user accounts. Let’s take a high-level look at how active directory authentication mechanism is established. This example will assume the user within an organization requires API access to S3, EC2, and RDS. This scenario will also include the use of an AWS service called Security Token Service, STS. The Security Token Service allows you to gain temporary security credentials for federated users via IAM, associated with IAM roles and policies. Let’s look at this in more detail via a diagram.</p>
<p>A user within an internal organization initiates a request to authenticate against the Active Directory Federated Service, an ADFS server, via a web browser using a single sign on URL. If their authentication is successful by using their Active Directory credentials, SAML will then issue a successful authentication assertion back to the user’s client, requesting federated access. The SAML assertion is then sent to the AWS Security Token Service, to assume a role within IAM using the AssumeRoleWithSAML API. STS then responds to the user requesting federated access with temporary security credentials, with an assumed role and associated permissions, allowing S3, EC2, and RDS access as per our example, the user then has federated access to the necessary AWS services as per the role’s permissions.</p>
<p>This is a very simple overview of how federation is instigated from the user for API access to specific AWS services. Corporate identity federation is always authenticated internally first by Active Directory before AWS, when creating your role for users federating via SAML, you can specify if you want to provide programmatic access only, or programmatic and AWS management Console access, in addition to specific permissions to access other AWS resources.</p>
<h1 id="IAM-AWS-Policy-Types"><a href="#IAM-AWS-Policy-Types" class="headerlink" title="IAM AWS Policy Types"></a>IAM AWS Policy Types</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I want to talk about four different policy types that you can expect to see when working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/overview-of-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam/introduction-81/">AWS IAM</a>. Identity-based policies. These policies can be attached to users, user groups or roles within IAM. Essentially, any entity that depicts an identity. Resource-based policies. Instead of being associated with an identity, these policies are attached in line to resources themselves. An example of a resource-based policy in IAM will be that of a role trust policy where the policy defines the principle that can assume the role.</p>
<p>Permission boundaries. These policies can be associated with a role or user, but they don’t actually grant permissions themselves, instead they define the maximum level of permissions that can be granted to an entity. Organization service control policies, SCPs. These are very similar to permission boundaries in the fact that they do not grant permissions. They define a boundary of maximum permissions. However, these service control policies are associated with an AWS account or organizational unit, an OU, when working with AWS organizations and govern the maximum permissions to the members of those accounts.</p>
<p>With all of these policy types, it’s easy to see why some people can get confused as to which type of policy is being used or should be used. So let me run through each of these policies in greater detail, starting with the identity-based policies.</p>
<p>As already highlighted, these policies can be attached to users, user groups, or roles and they control what permissions each of those entities have. Identity-based policies can either be managed or inline policies, but what does this mean? Well, managed policies are saved within the IAM library of policies and can be attached to any user, user group or role as and when required, and the same policy can be attached to multiple entities.</p>
<p>Managed policies also come in two different flavors, AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. AWS managed policies are policies that have been pre-configured by AWS and made available to you to help you manage some of the most common permissions that you may wish to assign. Some examples of AWS managed policies can be seen here. From the policy name, you can usually tell what access is being given, although you can expand upon each policy to see the JSON document that is associated.</p>
<p>Customer managed policies are those that you have created yourself, which can then be associated with a user, user group or role. You might want to create customer managed policies when the AWS managed policies do not meet your security requirements. For example, you might want to add additional granularity to the policy to restrict access at a specific API call level.</p>
<p>Let me now explain how inline policies contrast against managed policies. So inline policies are embedded directly into the entity, either the user, user group or role. The policy is not saved and stored in the IAM library policy, its only existence is within the associated entity. As a result, it can’t easily be replicated to other entities, it’s specific to that one user, user group or role, creating a one-to-one relationship. It’s not always best practice to use inline policies as they take a lot of administration to keep on top of and should only be used if absolutely necessary. For example, you might have some elevated permissions that you don’t want to have mistakenly given to someone else that they weren’t intended for.</p>
<p>Okay, let me now move onto resource-based policies. So resource-based policies are effectively inline policies that are associated with a resource instead of an identity. If you have been using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-to-amazon-s3/introduction/">Amazon S3</a> for any extended period of time, then you may have come across S3 bucket policies, which is a common resource-based policy where permissions to the bucket are defined at the resource level and defined which principle or principles can access the bucket based upon different actions.</p>
<p>When using roles within IAM, the role has a trust relationship policy, which is a resource-based policy. As a result, the permissions of the trust are embedded inline within the role itself. So in this instance, the resource is the role and the resource-based policy is the trust relationship. This example shows the resource-based policy of the trust relationship of one of my roles. In this policy, the user, Stuart is the principle and has the ability to assume the role. It is this parameter of principle which signifies the difference between an identity-based policy and a resource-based policy.</p>
<p>Identity-based policies don’t have that principle parameter as the policy is already associated within the identity. Resource-based policies must have the principle parameter to determine which identity that the policy permissions relate to. Next up, we have permission boundaries. So permission boundaries can only be associated with a user or role. It’s not possible to add a boundary to a group. They differ from both identity-based and resource-based policies in the fact that permission boundaries don’t grant permissions themselves. They act as a guide rail to limit the maximum level of permissions that the user or role can be given. The policy configured for the boundary can be an AWS managed or customer managed policy.</p>
<p>So let’s assume for example, that our user, Stuart has an identity-based policy associated with him that allows full access to S3 and full access to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-ec2/amazon-ec2/">EC2</a> using the following AWS managed policies. However, if a permission boundary was also configured for Stuart using the following AWS managed policies, which only grants read only access to S3, but still full access to EC2, then the resulting access for the user, Stuart would be full access to EC2, but only read only to Amazon S3 as the maximum permission defining by the permissions boundary was limited to read only despite the user having an identity-based policy associated granting full S3 access.</p>
<p>So the last policy I want to reference are the SCPs, the service control policies. So service control policies are used by AWS organizations and attached to AWS accounts or organizational units, OUs, to define the maximum permissions allowed for the members of the associated account or OU. So in a way they act in a similar fashion to that of permission boundaries, but at the account level and affect all members of those accounts.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS and EC2 via an identity-based policy. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2 despite having full access to S3. The SCP would serve to prevent service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<p>So to be clear, an SCP does not grant access, they add a guide route to define what is allowed. You’ll still need to configure your identity-based or resource-based policies to identities, granting permission to carry out actions within your accounts. If you want to use service control policies to help you manage your security at an account level, then you need to ensure that you deploy AWS organizations using the enable all feature setting.</p>
<p>Within IAM, you have the ability to view any SCPs that are applicable to your AWS account, the policy statement itself, it’s ARN, the number of entities it affects and you can also review access activity to learn when a principal within the organization last accessed a service. However, if you wanted to update or edit the SCP, then you’d have to do that from within the AWS organization service itself. The SCP can’t be edited from within IAM. For more information relating to how to implement, manage and secure AWS organizations using SCPs, then please see our existing course here.</p>
<h1 id="Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure"><a href="#Examining-the-JSON-Policy-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Examining the JSON Policy Structure"></a>Examining the JSON Policy Structure</h1><p>In this lecture, I will be taking a deep look at the syntax and structure of IAM policies. For both identity-based and resource-based policies, the syntax is the same, but you might use slightly different parameters. If you’ve worked with IAM at all before, then I am sure you have come across an IAM policy. After all, it is the component that defines what an identity can or can’t access. But what do these policies actually look like? IAM policies are formatted as JSON documents, JavaScript Object Notation, and each policy will have at least one statement where the structure may look like this example.</p>
<p>Let me break the structure of this policy down to allow you to understand each element. Version. This specifies the policy language version and specifies the language syntax used, and at the time of writing this course, the current policy version is 2012-10-17. Statement. This defines the main element of the policy, which will includes other sub-elements, including the Sid, Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition. These elements will identify the level of access granted or denied and to which resource. A policy must contain at least one statement, but it can also contain an array of statements. For each statement block, it must be enclosed within curly braces, but if you use an array of statements, then you must enclose the entire array within square brackets. And we shall look at an example of this during this lecture.</p>
<p>Sid. This is the statement ID, and it’s an optional parameter that allows you to set a unique identifier within the statement. As you add more arrays within your policy, it can be a good idea to include a Sid for each one, allowing you to name them appropriately, making them more easily identifiable. For example, AllowGetObjectForS3. Without reading the rest of the statement, you can get a good idea of what the permissions in this statement allows.</p>
<p>Effect. This element can be set to either Allow or Deny, which either grant or restrict access for the actions defined in the statement. By default, all access to your resources are denied and so, therefore, if this is set to Allow, it replaces the default denied access. Similarly, if this was set to Deny, it would override any previous Allow. An explicit Deny in a policy will always take precedence over any Allow.</p>
<p>Principal. This parameter defines which principal the policy relates to. The Principal is only used for resource-based policies, for example, those policies attached to S3 Buckets. When using identity-based policies, this parameter is not required within the policy as the policy itself is associated with the principal and not a resource. As an alternative to the Principal parameter, this could be replaced with the NotPrincipal parameter, which would specify the user, role, or AWS account that is not allowed or denied access to the associated resource.</p>
<p>Action. This is the action that will either be allowed or denied, depending on the value entered for the Effect parameter. Actions are effectively API calls for different services. As a result, different actions are used for each service. For example the DeleteBucket action is available for S3 but not EC2, and likewise, the CreateKeyPair action is available for EC2 but not S3. The action is prefixed with the associated AWS service. This example defines two actions, CreateTrail and DeleteTrail, for the CloudTrail service. As another example, you can see this one here with the asterisk, and this acts as a wildcard which represents all actions for the CloudTrail service, essentially granting full access to the service.</p>
<p>Similarly, as we had with the Principal parameter, we could replace the Action parameter with the NotAction instead, and this could help you optimize your policy by creating a shorter version, listing just a limited set of actions that should not match instead of creating a longer policy listing all that actions that should. An example of using the NotAction is shown here. This policy essentially allows all actions for CloudTrail apart from the DeleteTrail API, and this is because the NotAction parameter is being used.</p>
<p>Resource. This element specifies the actual resource you wish the Action and Effect to be applied to. AWS uses identifiers known as ARNs, Amazon Resource Names, to specify specific resources. Typically, ARNs follow a syntax of, arn, partition, service, region, account-id, and then resource. So the Partition element, this relates to the partition that the resource is found in. For standard AWS regions, this would be AWS. Service. This reflects the specific AWS service, for example, S3 or EC2.</p>
<p>Region. This is the region where the resource is located. Some services do not need a region specified, so this can sometimes be left blank. Account-ID. This is your AWS Account ID, without hyphens. Again, some services do not need this information and so can be left blank. Resource. The value of this field will depend on the AWS service you are using. For example, if I were using the action, Action:s3:PutObject, then I could use the bucket name that I wanted those permissions to apply to. Again, we also have a NotResource parameter that can be used to explicitly match all other resources except those specified. For example, this policy will allow access to all S3 buckets other than those specified by the NotResource parameter.</p>
<p>Condition. This is an optional element that allows you to control when the permissions will be effective based upon set criteria. The element itself is made up of a condition and a key value pair and all elements of the condition must be met for the permissions to be active. Let’s take a look at an example condition. In the example, the IP address is the condition itself, which the key value pair will be effective against. The aws:SourceIp is the Key and the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 is the value element of the key. So effectively, what this is saying is, if the Source IP address of the user who is requesting access via the policy is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range, then implement the permissions in the policy statement.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gone through the core parameters of an IAM policy, let’s take a look at a couple of examples to ensure we can understand the permissions that are being presented within the policy. As I mentioned previously, you can have multiple Sids within a statement, each granting a different level of access. The example below demonstrates this, and I have highlighted each a different color to show the separation.</p>
<p>So looking at this example policy, let’s determine what access is being granted. So in StatementBlock1, this allows any resource full access to CloudTrail on the condition that their source IP address is within the 10.10.0.0&#x2F;16 network range. StatementBlock2. This allows full access to all RDS databases using all API calls except for that of the rds:DeleteDBInstance due to the NotAction parameter being used instead of the Action being used. And in StatementBlock3, this allows the creation and deletion of S3 Buckets within the cloudacademy bucket on S3.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at another example policy, this time, a resource-based policy, and in this instance, it’s from an S3 bucket. So in this policy, it allows the user, Stuart, as highlighted by the Principal parameter, to create and delete buckets in addition to deleting the bucket policy. Stuart can also delete and put objects within the bucket, and the bucket that this policy refers to is the bucket named ca-bucket-uk, as defined by the Resource parameter. However, there is a condition bound to this policy that states that Stuart can only do this if he was authenticated via Multi-Factor Authentication, MFA. That should now give you more of an understanding of how JSON IAM policies work and what they look like.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy"><a href="#Creating-an-AWS-IAM-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Creating an AWS IAM Policy"></a>Creating an AWS IAM Policy</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I will show you how to create your IAM policies. Let’s start by creating an identity-based, customer managed policy, and there are a number of ways to create a customer managed policy, these being, copy an existing AWS Managed Policy. So we can copy an existing policy and then edit that policy to ensure it meets the requirements we need, and this can save us some time.</p>
<p>We can use the Policy Generator, and this allows you to create a customer managed policy by selecting options from a series of dropdown boxes. And we can also create our own policy. So if you’re proficient in JSON and the syntax of IAM policy writing, then you can write your own policies from scratch or paste in a JSON policy from another source. So I now want to give you a quick demonstration on how to create a policy in each of these three ways. And the demonstration will include, how to create a customer managed policy by editing an existing AWS managed policy, how to create a customer managed policy using the Policy Generator, and how to create a customer managed policy from scratch. So let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’ve logged into my AWS Management Console, and I’m at the IAM dashboard, and I’ve gone into Policies. So from here, we can create a number of different IAM policies. And the first method I’m going to show you is how to copy and import an existing AWS managed policy to create your own, if you need to make a few changes to it. So let’s go ahead and do that now. So from here, we need to go across to Create Policy.</p>
<p>Now, from here, we have an option on the top right here called Import Managed Policy, and that’s what we want to do. I want to import an AWS managed policy and then make a couple of small changes to it. So if I select Import Managed Policy and then find the policy that I want to find. So let’s, for example, look at AmazonS3FullAccess, import that, and we can see here that it’s imported the data. And if we look at the JSON tab, we can actually see the JSON format of that policy, and from here, we can directly make changes.</p>
<p>So for this quick demonstration, I want to copy this existing policy, but instead of allowing any resource, I want to specify my own resource for this, which will mean instead of this policy being, allow full access to Amazon S3, it allow full access to a specific bucket on Amazon S3. So let me go ahead and make those changes now. So I’m gonna change the asterisks from Resource and put in my own specific ARN of a bucket. So now, I’ve changed the resource to my own ARN.</p>
<p>So now, all I need to do is click on Next, go to Tags, and I can add any optional tags if I want. I’m just gonna leave that blank for this demonstration. Go across to Review, and here I can give this new policy a name. So I can call it S3FullAccessToMyBucket. And description, this allows full S3 access to ca-bucket-uk. And it gives you a summary of the policy here. So we can see the service that it’s using, the access level, and also the resource. Once we’re happy with that, we can simply click on Create Policy. And we can see that that policy has now been created.</p>
<p>Now, if we have a look at that policy, just by clicking on it there, it’ll take us straight to it, and we can see the JSON version of the policy. So that’s a very quick and easy way if you want to save yourself some time by copying existing S3 managed policies that are already there. Now, I chose a fairly simple policy just for demonstration, but there are some quite complex policies that AWS already have that you might need to just tweak a few changes to so you can simply import those existing managed policies, make your changes, and then save it as a new customer managed policy.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s the first method covered. Now, next, I want to show you how to create a policy using something called the AWS Policy Generator. Now, if you simply go to Google and type in the AWS Policy Generator, then it’ll come up straight away, and you’ll be brought to a page like this. Now, the actual URL of this Policy Generator, if you’d prefer to type it in, is awspolicygen.s3.amazonasw.com&#x2F;policygen.html. So this is a Policy Generator, and it allows you to easily create different types of AWS policies.</p>
<p>So if we look at this drop down list here, we can create an SQS policy, an S3 bucket policy, which, as we know, is a resource-based policy, a VPC endpoint policy, an IAM policy, and an SNS topic policy. We’re interested in the IAM policy. So if we select that, now, in step two, we can add our statements. Now, here, we have our effect, which can be allow or deny. So let’s say allow for this example. And then, we can select the service that we’re interested in. Let’s select Amazon S3 to keep it nice and simple. And now, we can select our actions.</p>
<p>Now, we can select individual actions here just through these tick boxes for any actions that we’re interested in. So I’ll just select a number of different ones there. And you can see here that it’s selected five actions. If you wanted all actions, you would simply tick this box. And then, you’d put in the ARN of the bucket. So let’s just put in that same bucket that we used in the previous example. And then, here, we can also add in any conditions that we’d like. So just through a series of dropdown boxes, you can specify any conditions that you’d like in there as well. And then, once you’re happy with your policy, simply select Add Statement. And here, it breaks down a summary as well. So it shows the effect, the action, the actions that we selected, the resource, and if there’s any conditions, which we didn’t specify any.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanted to, we can now add an additional statement. So for example, if we wanted to add some RDS elements in here as well, we can select AWS Service, select a load of actions, put in the ARN of your RDS database, and also add that statement to the same policy. Then, once you’re happy with your policy and the number of statements that you’ve added, simply click Generate Policy. And here, it shows you the JSON view of the policy that you would need based on your dropdown selection. So what you can do now is simply copy that, go back to IAM, go to your policies, Create Policy, go to the JSON tab, and simply paste it in. So it’s a very quick way of creating a policy through a series of dropdown boxes. And again, you can just progress through, adding any tags that you need to do, give this a name, ThisIsMyPolicy, and then click Create Policy. And again, you can see that this has been created. You can select that. And again, we can see the JSON statement there.</p>
<p>So now, we’ve looked at how to create a policy by copying an existing AWS managed policy. We’ve looked at how to use the AWS Policy Generator. Now, let’s just quickly review how to create a policy from scratch. So again, go back to Policies and then Create Policy. Now, you can either use this visual editor or go straight to JSON, and you can start typing out your policy in here as and how you need it, or you can use the visual editor, which is very similar to the Policy Generator we just looked at, where, again, you can choose a service, then the specific actions, say all S3 actions, then you can specify the resources, whether you want this, again, as an access point, a bucket, a job, an object. So you can say any object. Then, you can specify any conditions, if you need MFA or specific source IP, for example. And again, you can also add additional permissions here.</p>
<p>So almost like another statement. It’s very similar to the Policy Generator. But for me, personally, I think the Policy Generator is slightly easier to understand. And then, once you have your settings as you want them, and this has all been pre-filled from the options from the visual editor, and, again, click Tags, then Review, and then give this a name, MyPolicy, and then go to Create Policy. And if we take a look at the policy, we can just see its details again. And again, this shows the JSON view, et cetera. And if we wanted to edit the policy directly here, then we can. Click on Edit. Then, we can either edit through the visual editor, or we can directly edit the JSON view as well. So that’s just a couple of ways of creating your IAM policies in a few very simple steps.</p>
<h1 id="Policy-Evaluation-Logic"><a href="#Policy-Evaluation-Logic" class="headerlink" title="Policy Evaluation Logic"></a>Policy Evaluation Logic</h1><p>Every time someone tries to access a resource within AWS, the request is processed through a series of steps. One of which involves evaluating the level of permissions based upon the policies that are used. So let’s take a look at the whole process to understand how access is either granted or denied. And we can start with a simple four step process. So firstly authentication. We must first ensure that the principle sending the request is authenticated as a valid user.</p>
<p>Next, the context. Once authentication of the principle has been established, AWS then needs to determine the context of the request that is being asked, for example, what service or action is being requested. And this ensures that the relevant policies can be highlighted based on the request. We then have policy evaluation, and this is the part that we are interested in. Based on the request, there may be multiple policy types that need to be reviewed to determine the level of access, and I shall cover this in greater detail as we go through this lecture. And then finally, the result. AWS will determine if access is allowed or denied based upon the evaluation of all policies used.</p>
<p>So for this lecture, I want to focus purely on the third point, the policy evaluation and how that process is carried out. The rules for reviewing permissions across multiple policies in a single account is actually quite simple and can be summarized like this: by default, all access to a resource is denied. Access will only be allowed if an Allow has been specified within a policy associated with the principle. If a single Deny exists within any policy associated with the same principle against the same resource then that Deny will overrule any previous Allow that might exist for the same resource and action. So to reiterate, an explicit Deny will always take precedence over an Allow.</p>
<p>Now, there is an order in which policies are evaluated, and the following list of policies are shown in the order of evaluation. So firstly, we have any Organizational Service Control Policies. Then any Resource-based policies, then IAM permission boundaries, and then finally Identity-based policies. So let’s look at an example scenario. Let’s assume that the user, Stuart, is requesting to upload an object to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk using the s3:PutObject API.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s assume we have the following policies in place to see what happens at each step of the evaluation. So firstly, the evaluation will review any organization SCPs in place, and here is our example SCP. So this SCP will simply deny all access to RDS. So there is no Deny in place that affects the s3:PutObject requested by Stuart so the evaluation continues. Next, the evaluation will identify any resource-based policies, and here we have a Bucket Policy associated with the ca-bucket-uk as shown.</p>
<p>Again, there is no Deny here for the request in question, so the evaluation continues. Next, we have IAM Permission Boundaries. And this IAM Permission Boundary Policy is set on the user, Stuart. So this policy sets out a maximum permission boundary of full access to s3. Remember, permission boundaries do not actually grant permissions, they set the maximum privilege level, as full access to s3 allowed, the evaluation continues.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the evaluation of any Identity-based Policies, and this policy is associated to the group that the user, Stuart, belongs to. So as we can see, this policy allows any s3 action to the ca-bucket-uk. As a result, this permits Stuart to upload an object using s3:PutObject to the s3 bucket of ca-bucket-uk. So the final decision upon the policy evaluation is to allow the request.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-AWS-Trusted-Advisor"><a href="#What-is-AWS-Trusted-Advisor" class="headerlink" title="What is AWS Trusted Advisor?"></a>What is AWS Trusted Advisor?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I am going to be looking at AWS Trusted Advisor, explaining what it is and the different components that make up this service. </p>
<p>Trusted Advisor plays an integral part in helping you to optimize your infrastructure across a number of key areas, allowing you to make decisions upon recommendations made by the service which follow and best practices that have been honed over the years by AWS.</p>
<p>The service itself can be found within the AWS Management Console under the Management &amp; Governance category, alongside services such as Amazon CloudWatch, Control Tower and Systems Manager. </p>
<p>The main function of Trusted Advisor is to recommend improvements across your AWS account to help optimize and streamline your environment based on these AWS best practices. These recommendations cover 5 distinct categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost optimization</strong> - Helps to identify ways in which you could optimize your resources to help you reduce costs by implementing features such as reserved capacity and removing unused capacity</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - This reviews your resources to highlight any potential performance issues across your infrastructure, determining if you could take benefits from performance-enhancing capabilities such as provisioned throughput</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - This analyses your environment for any potential security weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to a breach.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong> - This helps to suggest best practices to maintain service operations by increasing resiliency, should a fault or incident occur across your resources.</li>
<li><strong>Service Limit</strong> - This identifies and warns you when your resources reach 80% capacity of their service limit quota.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within each of these 5 categories, Trusted Advisor has a list of control points and checks to see how your account, resources and architecture is implemented to determine if you’re aligned with best practice. So it essentially acts as an automatic auditor across your account, which can save you money, increase the efficiency of your resources, maintain a tighter and more secure environment, help to ensure your resources remain operational should a failure occur and that you remain in line with your service limitations, allowing you to request an increase where possible.</p>
<p>Between the 5 different categories and at the time of writing this course, there are over 115 different checks. Please note, that the number of these checks are constantly changing, so for the most up to date figures, please review the following link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/</a></p>
<p>Although there are a lot of these checks that Trusted Advisor can perform, not all of them are freely available to anyone with an AWS account. The list of checks that you have access to is very dependent on the support agreement with hold with AWS.</p>
<p>The full power and potential of AWS Trusted Advisor is only available if you have a Business or Enterprise Support Plan with AWS. Without either of these plans then you will only have access to 6 core checks in the security category and all the Service Limits </p>
<p>The 6 checks within security are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>S3 Bucket permissions</li>
<li>Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted</li>
<li>EBS Public Snapshots</li>
<li>RDS Public Snapshots</li>
<li>IAM Use</li>
<li>MFA on root account</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing this course, here are the available service limit checks.</p>
<p>Now if you compare this to the full list of checks here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/</a></p>
<p>….that are included with Business and Enterprise support plans, you will see that the full checklist can provide a huge wealth of valuable information to help you optimise your infrastructure. </p>
<p>In addition to these extra checks that these support plans offer, you will also get the additional benefit of being able to administer certain functions of Trusted Advisor, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>being able to track the most recent changes to your AWS account by bringing them to the top of your AWS Trusted Advisor dashboard.</li>
<li>using the AWS Support API to retrieve and refresh trusted advisor results. </li>
<li>Also you’ll have the added advantage of having Amazon CloudWatch integration to detect and react to changes made to your Trusted Advisor checks</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of features that everyone has access to, including those outside of the Enterprise and Business support plans, these being:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trusted Advisor Notifications</strong> - This is an opt-in or opt-out feature which is completely free to everyone and can be configured within the preferences pane of the Trusted Advisor console. It tracks your resource check changes and cost saving estimates over the course of a week and it will then email up to 3 recipients, for billing, operations and security notifications with a report.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exclude Items</strong> - This allows you to select specific resources to be excluded from appearing in the console within a specific check. You may want to do this if you are not interested in the reporting for that particular resource and so you decide to exclude it. You can decide to include it again at any point if you do change your mind. This feature can make viewing and managing your checks easier by eliminating some resources within the console.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Action Links</strong> - Many of the items identified within the Checks against resources have hyperlinks associated, these are known as Action Links which allow quick access to the resource in question allowing you to remediate the issue identified. For example, if you reached 80% of the number of VPC’s within a Region, the <strong>‘VPC’</strong> Service Limit Check would highlight this as an issue. The Action Link against the resource would lead you to an AWS Support Center page to create a case to increase the quantity of VPCs you’re allowed within a single region.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Access Management</strong> - AWS Trusted Advisor is tightly integrated within Identity &amp; Access Management. You can grant different levels of access to Trusted Advisor, including Full Access, Read Only, or even restrict access down to specific Categories, Checks and Actions. For example, the following IAM policy allows access to AWS Trusted Advisor, but denies the user from performing a refresh and updating notification preferences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of IAM permissions using the trustedadvisor namespace please see the following AWS reference: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/security-trusted-advisor.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/security-trusted-advisor.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refresh</strong> - The data within Trusted Advisor is automatically refreshed if the data is more than 24 hours old when you view it within the console. However, after any refresh, you can perform a manual refresh 5 minutes after the previous refresh. You can either choose to perform a refresh against individual checks or against all checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I finish this lecture I just want to give a high level overview of how Trusted Advisor works in a few simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you connect to AWS Trusted Advisor, the service will scan your infrastructure </li>
<li>It will then compare the state of your infrastructure against best practices defined within the 5 categories of Cost Optimization, Security, Performance, Fault Tolerance and service limits</li>
<li>The output of this scan will generate a number of recommendations of how your infrastructure could be optimised with a priority factor</li>
<li>This then allows you to optimize your resources based on the recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS Trusted Advisor uses a service-linked IAM role to access you resources, named <strong>AWSTrustedAdvisorServiceRolePolicy.</strong> This is a predefined role created by AWS and allows the services to call other services on your behalf. The policy summary of this role is as shown here and helps to define which AWS services that Trusted Advisor communicates with.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this list will change over time, so for an updated list please refer to the role within IAM to determine which services <strong>AWSTrustedAdvisorServiceRolePolicy</strong> has access to.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Organizations"><a href="#AWS-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="AWS Organizations"></a>AWS Organizations</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture where I will start this course by providing an overview of AWS Organizations as a foundation before focusing on the service control policies.</p>
<p>As businesses expand their footprint on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> and utilize more services to build and deploy their applications, it will soon become apparent that the need for multiple AWS accounts is required to manage the environment and infrastructure effectively.</p>
<p>This multi-account strategy is beneficial for a number of reasons as your organization scales, and for example, multi-account strategies include cost optimization and billing, security and governance, management and control of workloads, resource grouping, and helping to define business units.</p>
<p>As you begin to expand with multiple accounts, it will become increasingly more difficult to manage them as separate entities. The more accounts you have, the more distributed your environment becomes and the associated security risks and exposures increase and multiply.</p>
<p>However, with AWS Organizations, it can provide a means of centrally managing and categorizing multiple AWS accounts that you own, bringing them together into a single organization, which helps to maintain your AWS environment from a security, compliance, and account management perspective.</p>
<p>To understand how AWS Organizations operates, we first need to be aware of the hierarchy of the service’s components.</p>
<p>AWS Organizations uses the following components to help you manage your accounts: Organizations, Root, Organizational Units, Accounts, Service Control Policies.</p>
<p>An Organization is an element that serves to form a hierarchical structure of multiple AWS accounts. You could think of an organization as a family tree which provides a graphical view of your entire AWS account structure. At the very top of this Organization, there will be a Root container.</p>
<p>The Root object is simply a container that resides at the top of your Organization. All of your AWS accounts and Organizational units will then sit underneath this Root. Within any Organization, there will only be one single Root object.</p>
<p>Organizational Units (OUs) provide a means of categorizing your AWS Accounts. Again, like the Root, these are simply containers that allow you to group together specific AWS accounts. An organizational unit (or OU) can connect directly below the Root or even below another OU (which can be nested up to 5 times). This allows you to create a hierarchical structure as I mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Accounts. These are your AWS accounts that you use and create to be able to configure and provision AWS resources. Each of your AWS accounts has a 12 digit account number.</p>
<p>Service control policies, or SCPs, allow you to control what services and features are accessible from within an AWS account. These SCPs can either be associated with the Root, Organizational Units, or individual accounts. When an SCP is applied to any of these objects, its associated controls are fed down to all child objects. Think of it as a permission boundary that sets the maximum permission level for the objects that it is applied to.</p>
<p>Now we have an understanding of what AWS Organizations is exactly, what benefits can this bring to your AWS environment?</p>
<p>The primary benefit that this service brings is its ability to centrally manage multiple Accounts from a single AWS account, known as the master account. You can start by inviting your existing accounts to an Organization and then create new accounts directly from the Master Account.</p>
<p>Greater control of your AWS environment. Through the use of Service Control Policies attached to the Root, Organizational Units or individual accounts, administrators of the master account gain powerful control over which services and features—even down to specific API calls—that an IAM user within those accounts can use, regardless of the user’s identity-based or resource-based permissions. Consolidated Billing. The master account of your AWS Organization can be used to consolidate the billing and costs from all member AWS accounts. This allows for greater overall cost management across your individual AWS accounts. Categorization and grouping of accounts. By leveraging Organizational Units, you can segregate and group-specific AWS accounts together, applying different SCPs associated to each OU. For example, you may have a number of AWS accounts that must not have the ability to access any AWS Analytical services. In this case, you could place these accounts into a single OU and assign an SCP that denies this functionality.</p>
<h1 id="Implementing-AWS-Organizations"><a href="#Implementing-AWS-Organizations" class="headerlink" title="Implementing AWS Organizations"></a>Implementing AWS Organizations</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture which will explain how to initially set up and configure AWS organizations. Setting up an organization is a very simple process that starts from a master AWS account. Your master account is a standard <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> account that you have chosen to create the AWS organization. It’s best practice to use this AWS account solely as a master account, and not to use it to provision any other resources such as EC2 instances, et cetera. This allows you to restrict access to the master account at a greater level. The few users who need access to it, the better, and you need to do this because the master account carries certain administrative level capabilities such as being able to create additional AWS accounts within your organization, invite other accounts to join your organization, remove AWS accounts from your organization, and apply security features via policies to different levels within your organization.</p>
<p>Once you have selected your AWS account to be used as a master account, you can create an organization. From here, you have two choices when creating an organization type: enable all features or enable only consolidated billing. If you want to set up service control policies, then you need to select enable all features.</p>
<p>The second option allows you to control payments and manage costs centrally from that master account across all associated AWS accounts within the organization. When the organization is created, the master account can create organizational units for AWS account management as required. The master account can also invite other member AWS accounts to join the organization. During this invitational process, the account owner of these invited AWS accounts will receive an email requesting that their AWS account join the organization. Once the accounts have joined the organization, the master account can then move these accounts into the corresponding OUs that have been created and associate relevant service control policies with them.</p>
<p>Let me now show you via demonstration on how to create a new organization and invite an existing account to join it. Now I’m logged into my AWS management console in the AWS account that I want to be the master account, and the first thing I need to do is go to AWS organizations, which is under the management and governance category, and you can see, it’s just at the top here.</p>
<p>So if I go into organizations, and at the moment, I don’t have any organizations set up or created. So the first thing I need to do is click on create organization, and this gives you a quick, high-level screenshot just to explain what creating an organization does. So it provides single payer and centralized cost tracking, it lets you create and invite accounts, it allows you to apply policy-based controls, and it helps you simplify organization-wide management of AWS services.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned previously, there’s two options when you create your organization. You can only create it with all features enabled, which is what I just listed, or as you can see here, you can just create your organization to consolidate your billing features. With this demonstration, I’m going to create it with all features. So let’s go ahead and create our organization, and that’s effectively it. So it’s very easy to create your AWS organization to start with, and because this is a brand new organization, this is my master account, which is signified by this star here, and this is my account name, and my account ID.</p>
<p>So, to actually create the organization is very simple, but now I want to add another account as a member account, so let me go ahead and do that. So if I select add account, now I have two options here. I can invite an existing account or create a new account. Now I already have another AWS account, so I’m going to invite an existing account. Now I need to enter the email or account ID, so I’ll just paste in my account, and you can add any notes here, for example, please join my organization, and then you select invite.</p>
<p>Okay, now we can see that we have a request that’s been sent as an invitation. The status is currently open. So now the email address that was registered with this account will get an invitation and they must accept that invite into this organization. So let’s take a look and see if I got that email. So here we can see the email that’s been sent to the owner of that member account, and it says, Stuart would like to add your AWS account to their organization as a member account, and then it just gives some additional blurb about AWS organizations, but to accept the invitation, and to understand what features have been enabled, we need to click on this link here.</p>
<p>So if I select that link, and sign in to my account using my details and MFA code, then I can see that I have an invitation from AWS organizations. We can see the organization ID, the master account name, and the requested controls, which is enable all features. So here, I can either accept or decline and I’m going to accept. I just need to confirm the confirmation message about joining the organization.</p>
<p>Okay, now this member account is now a part of that organization. So if I go back to my master account now, I can see now that within my AWS organization of my master account, I have the CA demo account, which is the name of my other account, and we can see that it’s not a master because it hasn’t got the star whereas this account has the, this is the master account. So as you can see, it’s a very simple process to invite other accounts to your organization.</p>
<p>Now I also mentioned previously about organizing accounts and using organizational units. So if we select organize accounts, at the moment, we only have the root in here. So I can create the new organizational unit and assign each of these accounts into those. So, for example, let me create a new organizational unit called production.</p>
<p>Now I’m also going to create a second organizational unit called test. So let me create another one. At the moment, under root, we have our two accounts. So we have our master account and our member account here. Now I want to move my master account into the production organizational unit, just to make things a little more organized. So I can select the account, click on move, and then simply select where I want it to reside within the tree, and then click move, and we can see, it’s now been removed from the root location, and I want to do the same with the member account, but this time, I want to move that into the test OU. So now, if I click on production over here, this organizational unit, we can see the account that it has inside it, and again, if we go back to the root and click on test, we can see that we have the member account. So I just wanted to show you that quickly just to show you how you can easily and quickly organize your different AWS accounts.</p>
<p>Okay, and that’s the end of the demonstration.</p>
<h1 id="Securing-Your-Organizations-with-Service-Control-Policies"><a href="#Securing-Your-Organizations-with-Service-Control-Policies" class="headerlink" title="Securing Your Organizations with Service Control Policies"></a>Securing Your Organizations with Service Control Policies</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this lecture which will dive into Service Control Policies to understand how they can be used to secure your AWS Organization. SCPs are different from both identity-based and resource-based policies, which grant permissions to users, groups, and roles. However, SCPs do not actually grant permission themselves. Restrictions made within an SCP set a boundary of permissions for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> accounts.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a user within an AWS account had full access to S3, RDS, and EC2 via an identity-based policy. If the SCP associated with that AWS account denied access to the S3 service, then that user would only be able to access RDS and EC2, despite having full access to S3. The SCP would serve to prevent that service from being used within the AWS account and so have the overriding precedence and determine the maximum level of permissions allowed.</p>
<p>So to be clear, an SCP does not grant access. They add a guardrail to define what is allowed. You will still need to configure your identity-based or resource-based policies to identities, granting permission to carry out actions within your accounts. If you want to use Service Control Policies to help you manage your security at an account level, then you need to ensure that you deploy AWS Organizations using the enable all features setting.</p>
<p>Before you start using SCPs, you first need to enable them from the root account of your organization. However, you need to ensure that you have the following permissions. From within your AWS Organizations console, navigate to the Policies tab and select the Service Control Policies option that will show the status of Disabled. Then, select the option to enable the SCPs as shown. At this point, SCPs will now be enabled at the root level of your organization and you can now begin to use Service Control Policies within your organization.</p>
<p>I now want to perform a demonstration showing you how to create a Service Control Policy and attach it to an account. In this demonstration, I will have two accounts; my master account called Stuart and another account called CA-Demo. In the CA-Demo account, I have a user, Alice, who has an IAM policy attached that allows full access to S3. From within my master account, I will create a new Service Control Policy denying access to the Amazon S3 service. I will then attach this new SCP to the CA-Demo account. I will then log in as Alice and try to access Amazon S3 to see the result. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Okay, so to start this demonstration, I’m logged in as the user Alice in this CA-Demo account which is my member account to my organization. And as I said previously, Alice only has access to Amazon S3. So if we take a look at S3, we should be able to get into the service without any issues. So we can get into the service which is great and also create a bucket as well, so a bucket for Alice. And there we have it. So this user Alice is able to access S3 and also create buckets as well.</p>
<p>Now what I want to do is swap back over to my master account of my AWS Organization, create a Service Control Policy to block access to Amazon S3 and then apply it to this account. So let’s do that next. Okay, so I’m now back in my master account and what I want to do is to create a new Service Control Policy. So from the AWS Organizations dashboard, if I click on Policies, now I already have my Service Control Policies enabled, if yours says disabled, simply select it and then you’ll have the option to enable it.</p>
<p>Once your Service Control Policies are enabled, if you select them, now we can create a policy. We have a default policy here which is FullAWSAccess which allows access to every operation and this is the default Service Control Policy that’s applied to the root of my AWS Organization. However, what I want to do is deny access to one of those services. So if I select create policy, I’ll just call this Deny S3, give it a description of deny access to S3, and then down here is where we can build our policy. So there’s different options.</p>
<p>Firstly, the statement and then the resource and any conditions. So to start with, we can see that over here our policy is in a deny state. Now if we wanted to allow access to a service, we’ll change that to allow. But I’m gonna leave that as deny and over here I wanna select my service that I want to deny so let me scroll down to S3, if I can just find it in the list, there we go, and I want to prevent all actions of S3. Now as we can see, it’s now updated this policy with the action of all actions to S3, but we don’t have the resource yet. So let’s now scroll down to add resource. So our service is S3 and our resource type would be all resources. So if I select add resource, we can now see that the policy has been updated again. So at the moment, it’s denying any action in S3 for all resources.</p>
<p>Now if I wanted to add a condition, then I could add any conditions in here with the condition key and qualifier, et cetera. For this demonstration, I’m not going to add any conditions.</p>
<p>Now I just need to create the policy. Okay, so that’s our policy created. Now although the policy has been created, it’s not actually attached to any organization unit or account thus yet. So let me go back to my accounts. Now if you remember from a previous demonstration, we had our member account, the CA-Demo account, within the Test OU. So I’m going to select that account, go across the Service Control Policies, and then we can see that we have this policy here that we just created and I want to attach that to this specific account. So if I select attach, we can now see that this account has two Service Control Policies, the FullAWSAccess which is filtered down from the root which allows access to all S3 resources, but we also have a Service Control Policy here that denies access to one of those services and the deny will always overrule an allow.</p>
<p>So now we’ve attached that Service Control Policy to the CA-Demo account which is the account that Alice is a part of. Let me now log back in as Alice into this account to see if I can now access S3 or if the Service Control Policy has been applied. So let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Okay, so I’m back in my CA-Demo account which is the member account. I’m logged in as Alice. So now if I go to S3, let’s see what happens. We have an error of access denied and we can’t see any buckets. So it looks as though that Service Control Policy has taken effect because I can’t access S3 at all. So let me see if I can create a bucket, if I just add in any name, and try to create, again we get an error of access denied. So we can see that the Service Control Policy has in fact now blocked access for Alice despite her having IAM permissions allowing her full access to S3. You would have noticed that in my list of SCPs from the demonstration I just carried out there was a pre-existing SCP there called FullAWSAccess and this was associated with the root object of my Organization, so how does the inheritance of SCPs work? Well, let’s take a look at an example.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose we had the following AWS Organization layout, with the FullAWSAccess SCP at the root. The objects within an Organization follow a parent-child relationship, with the Root being the parent to all other child objects. As you can see at the root level, we have an SCP that allows full access to AWS. I now want to establish what SCPs each of the five AWS accounts, highlighted in orange, is governed by. So looking at Account 1, looking from the root, we have the FullAWSAccess SCP. The next level down to Account 1 is the Dev OU. Now, this has four SCPs associated. However, these are number 2, 3, 5 and 6. So at this stage, only the services and features within these SCPs are allowed at this level.</p>
<p>Now if we go down further to Account #1, we have another OU, the Test OU, which again is governed by a list of SCPs, 3, 5 and 6. We can see at this level of the tree, SCP 2 has been dropped so this OU is now restricted to SCP 3, 5 and 6. Therefore, Account 1 which is a child of the Test OU is restricted and governed by the details set out in these three SCPs. Using this methodology, we can now look at the other accounts. So Account #2 is governed by SCP 2, 3, 5 and 6. Account #3 is governed by 1 and 6. And Accounts 4 and 5 are governed by SCP 4.</p>
<p>Let me now look at a different example, this time I’m going to remove the default SCP of FullAWSAccess at the root and replace it with custom SCPs as shown here. Now I’m going to assume in this scenario that every SCP shown has different service restrictions. So as you can see, at the root level this time we have four SCPs, number 1 through to 4, so let’s see how this affects the results this time for each account. So Account #1, looking from the root, we have SCPs 1 through to 4, the next level down to Account #1 is the Dev OU. Now, this also has four SCPs associated. However, these are number 2, 3, 5 and 6. As a result, this Dev OU is only controlled by SCPs 2 and 3. SCPs 5 and 6 are discarded as they are not a part of the parent relationship with the Root object, and 5 and 6 do not exist at any parent level.</p>
<p>Now if we go down further to Account 1, we have another OU, the Test OU, which again is governed by a list of SCPs, 3, 5 and 6. We already know that 5 and 6 are not allowed as they are not in the parent chain. However, SCP number 3 is. So SCP 3 exists from the root downwards in this OU. Therefore, Account #1 is restricted and governed by the details set out in SCP 3. Using this methodology, we can now look at the other accounts. So Account #2 is governed by SCP 2 and 3. Account #3 is governed by SCP 1. And Account #4 and #5 are governed by SCP 4.</p>
<p>Finally, before I end this lecture, please be aware of some of the characteristics of Service Control Policies. SCPs do not affect resource-based policies. They only affect principals managed by your accounts in your organization. SCPs affect all users and roles, in addition to the root user. However, the root user will still be able to change its own password including MFA settings, manage root access keys, and manage x.509 keys for the root user. If you disable SCPs in your organization, all SCPs are deleted and removed. Re-enabling SCPs again in the same organization will revert to the default SCP allowing FullAWSAccess. The following elements are not affected by SCPs: any actions performed by the master account, SCPs do not affect service-linked roles, and managing Amazon CloudFront keys.</p>
<p>That now brings me to the end of this lecture and to the end of this course. You should now have a greater understanding of how Service Control Policies can be used within your AWS Organization to help you centrally control the different levels of access between multiple accounts.

<h1 id="An-Overview-of-AWS-WAF"><a href="#An-Overview-of-AWS-WAF" class="headerlink" title="An Overview of AWS WAF"></a>An Overview of AWS WAF</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture where I shall give an introduction to the AWS WAF service. If you are delivering any kind of web content, either through CloudFront Distributions, Amazon API Gateway REST APIs, Application Load Balancers, or via AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs, then I would recommend you implement the AWS Web Application Firewall service as an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>Without using a web application firewall you could be exposing your websites and web apps to potentially harmful and malicious traffic, which could lead to security risks within your environment. This could have a significant detrimental impact on your business from both a financial and reputation perspective. The AWS Web Application Firewall is a service that helps to prevent websites or web applications from being maliciously attacked by common web attack patterns. Many of which are outlined in the OWASP top 10 list, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.</p>
<p>In addition to your own custom criteria, such as perhaps filtering request based on source IP address or country of origin. OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to helping others improve security and software. They provide a top 10 list of the most critical security vulnerabilities and risks surrounding application architecture. For the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">latest OWASP top 10 list</a>, please visit the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">link</a>.</p>
<p>If you can implement a WAF within your architecture to mitigate against some of these vulnerabilities, then that’s a huge asset to your web application architecture and a great relief to the security officers within your organization. If you then compare the implementation and administration time needed to deploy AWS WAF to a standard WAF solution, then it’s by far quicker. Further, AWS WAF is far simpler and easy to manage as well. And there are currently two versions of AWS WAF. AWS WAF classic, and AWS WAF, sometimes referred to as new AWS WAF.</p>
<p>Now you should only use AWS WAF classic if you created AWS WAF resources prior to November, 2019. So in this course, I shall be focusing on new AWS WAF. The AWS WAF service interacts with Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront for its distributions, Application Load Balances, and AWS AppSync, ensuring only filtered web requests that meet specific conditions are forwarded to be processed by these services. WAF works with these other services to filter both HTTP and HTTPS requests by distinguishing between legitimate and harmful inbound requests that will then either be allowed or blocked.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what the WAF service is composed of to allow you to understand how it works. So there are a number of essential components relating to WAF. These being Web ACLs, Rules and Rule Groups. Let me explain each of these individually to see what part they play within the service, starting with the main building block of the configuration, the Web ACL. So Web Access Control lists, or web ACL, are the main building block of the WAF service. And it’s used as the component that is associated with one of the supported resources to determine which web requests are considered safe and which ones are not.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this course, the supported resources include Amazon CloudFront Distributions, Amazon API Gateway REST APIs, Application Load Balances, and AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs. The Web ACL contains rules, which contains specific controls and criteria checks that assess each web request to determine whether it should be allowed or blocked. Also for each Web ACL, there is a default action that traffic should take if the criteria set out in the rules are not met by the incoming request, and the options for this are either allow or block.</p>
<p>Rules. Each rule contains statements and actions, which focus on specific criteria that the web request will be inspected against. If the inspected request matches the criteria set out in the statement, then that is considered a match. The result of this match can then follow an action of allow, block, or count. Allow means the request is forwarded onto the resource. Block means the request is dropped and a response is sent back to the requester, informing them that the request was denied, and count simply counts the number of matching requests.</p>
<p>Rule Groups. A Rule Group is essentially a collection of rules that you can apply to different Web ACLs as you need to. AWS WAF also comes pre-configured with a number of AWS manageable groups that have been built and designed to protect your resources against some common attack patterns. In addition to this, you can also get access to other Rule Groups created and sold by other vendors on the AWS marketplace. So from a logical architecture perspective, let’s assume that WAF has been associated with a CloudFront Distribution with its origin pointing to S3. The network diagram would look as follows at a high level.</p>
<p>So firstly, a user would initiate a request to the web content being served by the CloudFront Distribution. Next, although logically AWS WAF sits in front of CloudFront, the request will be received by the CloudFront Distribution first. Then it’s immediately forwarded to your associated WAF Web ACL. The AWS WAF Web ACL associated with the distribution would filter the incoming web traffic using the Rules or Rule Groups. So before it’s even traversed your CloudFront environment and network, you have the ability to detect, analyze, and either allow or block the incoming request.</p>
<p>If the criteria highlighted by the Rules deemed that the request should be blocked, then the traffic would be stopped and prevented from progressing further. The requester would then be informed the request was denied. If the traffic met the criteria, allowing the traffic to pass, then the request would be forwarded to CloudFront. CloudFront would then serve the content as required. You might already have other security detection mechanisms within your organization that operate deeper within your infrastructure, perhaps at the web server layer, to mitigate against some of the same risks that WAF does.</p>
<p>And so you may be thinking, why should I implement WAF if I have this existing solution, which is working okay? If you have existing detection systems within your infrastructure, then that’s great. However, the closer they are logically implemented to your web application, then the greater the risk of additional vulnerabilities occurring towards the edge of your infrastructure. It’s best to mitigate vulnerability risks as close to the perimeter of your network environment as possible. By doing so, reduces the chances of other infrastructure and systems being compromised.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Firewall-Manager-and-Prerequisites"><a href="#AWS-Firewall-Manager-and-Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="AWS Firewall Manager and Prerequisites"></a>AWS Firewall Manager and Prerequisites</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this lecture, where I should provide an overview of AWS Firewall Manager, so, you can understand what the service is used for. The core function of AWS Firewall Manager is to help you simplify the management of being able to provide security protection to a range of different resources, between multiple AWS accounts. It’s the fact that it works across multiple account infrastructure, that gives this service a lot of power from a security perspective. So, it’s a great tool to become familiar with, if you are responsible for security across more than one AWS account.</p>
<p>Once your configured security policies to govern the protections that you require for your resources, AWS Firewall Manager, will then automatically apply this protection in addition to managing this protection for any newly creative resources, that match your configuration across any of your accounts that it has responsibility for. So, once it’s set up, the management and protection efforts are simplified dramatically, across your entire organization.</p>
<p>The current AWS services and resources that Firewall Manager provides protection for and integrate with, include the following; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/protecting-web-apps-aws-waf-shield-firewall-manager/introduction/">AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, AWS Network Firewall</a>, VPC Security Groups and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/introduction-dns-content-delivery-aws/amazon-route-53/">Amazon Route 53</a> Resolver DNS Firewall. In addition to these resources that are protected, Firewall Manager is also closely integrated with AWS Organizations. In fact, running AWS Organizations is a prerequisite of using Firewall Manager. For those I’m familiar with AWS Organizations, it’s a service which provides a means of centrally managing and categorizing multiple AWS accounts that you own, bringing them together into a single organization.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the prerequisites of Firewall Manager in a little more detail, to allow you to begin using the service. So, the first step is to decide which AWS account will be used as your Firewall Manager Administrator account. And this account will be used to essentially manage your security policies. Next, you must ensure that this account is a part of an AWS Organization. However, the that it joins must be configured with all features enabled, and not just consolidated billing.</p>
<p>When your account has successfully joined an AWS Organization, you must then configure AWS Firewall Manager within that account, as the Firewall Manager Administrator Account. And this administrator account is used to create a manager security policies. To delegate your account as the administrator, open the Firewall Manager Console, select, get started and enter the account number of your AWS account. Once you’ve added your AWS account to an AWS Organization and designated the Firewall Manager administrative account, you’ll see confirmation ticked on the Firewall Manager dashboard as seen to reflect that you have met these prerequisites.</p>
<p>Next, you must enable AWS config for your account, and for any other account in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/securing-aws-organizations-with-service-control-policies-scps/introduction/">AWS Organization</a> that you want to manage resource security for. And it must be enabled for each region in that account, in which the resources reside. If you don’t want to enable AWS conflict for all resources in each of your accounts, then you must ensure that you enable the following depending on which resources you want Firewall Manager to secure. The next step is optional, depending on if you are looking to apply security policies for all Network Firewalls and DNS Firewalls.</p>
<p>Then you must enable sharing with AWS Organizations in AWS Resource Access Manager. By doing so, it allows you to deploy security policies to these resource types, using Firewall Manager across your accounts in your organization. To complete this configuration, you must open the settings page in the AWS Resource Access Manager Console, and then from here, select, enable sharing with AWS Organizations, and then select, safe settings.</p>
<p>The final step allows Firewall Manager to manage resources in regions, that might be disabled by default. So, you must enable these regions before you can create and managed resources within them. These regions must being enabled in the AWS management account, for your AWS Organization, in addition to the AWS account designated as your Firewall Administrator account. Enabling a region is a simple process. From within the AWS Management Console, navigate to the top right corner and select your account, and then select my account, scroll down to regions section and select, enable in the action column, for the regions that you would like to enable. Once you’ve completed these initial steps you are ready to begin configuring AWS Firewall Manager and its policies.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-AWS-Shield"><a href="#What-is-AWS-Shield" class="headerlink" title="What is AWS Shield?"></a>What is AWS Shield?</h1><p>Hello and welcome to this section of the course focusing on the third and final service, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> Shield. AWS Shield is closely related to both AWS WAF and also the AWS Firewall Manager. So what is it used for? Well, AWS Shield has been designed to help protect your infrastructure against distributed denial of service attacks, commonly known as DDoS. These attacks are very common, and the attack itself targets a host which might be running a website or web application, and it receives a huge number of requests simultaneously sent maliciously by an attacker from multiple distributed sources. This increase and flood of traffic aims to prevent legitimate requests getting through to host and being processed, while at the same time severely hindering the performance of the application or website. So much so in fact, that users often think the site is down. </p>
<p>There are a number of different types of DDoS takes that can take place, for example, a SYN Flood. In a Syn Flood attack, a large number of connections are made to the host under attack. The host will then respond accordingly with an SYN&#x2F;ACK packet, at which point the client sending the original connection request would normally respond with another SYN, completing the three-way handshake to allow communications to begin. However, this final SYN packet is not sent to the host, and this leaves a huge number of open connections on the host, resulting in diminished resources available to process legitimate requests. DNS Query Flood. By using multiple DNS queries an attacker can drain the resources against a DNS server, such as Route 53 in AWS. HTTP flood and cache-busting attacks. These attacks operate at layer seven, the application layer. And during an HTTP flood attack an attacker sends a large amount of HTTP requests, which may include POST and GET requests to a host, consuming the resources available. Cache-busting attacks are similar to HTTP floods, however, by using the HTTP request query string they are able to force content to be retrieved from the originating server, rather than from an edge location, which impacts the performance of the source servers available resources unnecessarily. AWS Shield itself is available at two different levels of features, AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced, and AWS shield advanced has a lot more power and protection on offer than standard. AWS Shield Standard is free to everyone, well, at least anyone who has an AWS account, and it offers DDoS protection against some of the more common layer three, the network layer, and layer four, transport layer, DDoS attacks. This protection is integrated with both CloudFront and Route 53. </p>
<p>AWS Shield advanced offers a greater level of protection for DDoS attacks across a wider scope of AWS services for an additional cost. This advanced level offers protection against your web applications running on EC2, CloudFront, ELB and also Route 53. In addition to these additional resource types being protected, there are enhanced levels of DDoS protection offered compared to that of Standard. And you will also have access to a 24-by-seven specialized DDoS response team at AWS, known as DRT. With these additional features, the advanced level also provides an enhanced monitoring capability allowing you to view real-time metrics of any attacks against your resources. Whereas the Standard version of Shield offered protection against layer three and layer four, Advanced also offers protection against layer seven, application, attacks. Another great advantage is the fact that you also get cost protection as a part of the plan, whereby your resources may scale suddenly and unexpectedly to cope with the rise in traffic. From a cost perspective, if your decide to go with AWS Shield Advanced then you also get AWS WAF included in the same price, and this price is currently $3,000 a month, plus data transfer fees. As you can see from this image, there are a significant amount of advantages with the Advanced version of AWS Shield over Standard. That now brings me to the end of this lecture.</p>
<h1 id="Amazon-Inspector-Basic-Features"><a href="#Amazon-Inspector-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Inspector Basic Features"></a>Amazon Inspector Basic Features</h1><p>You need to be responsible for the security of applications, processes, and tools that run on EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector lets you analyze your deployed EC2 instances and helps you identify potential security issues. Some of the basic features include a knowledge base with hundreds of rules that are mapped to common security compliance standards and vulnerability definitions. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security experts. You can install an agent in the operating system of an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor behavior like network, file system, and process activity.</p>
<p>You can also automate vulnerability assessments to make security testing of EC2 instances a regular part of your cloud operations. As a result, Amazon Inspector gives you a prioritized list of findings. A sample list of findings is shown. Amazon inspector is all about protecting the security of your EC2 instances.</p>
<h1 id="Amazon-Guard-Duty-Basic-Features"><a href="#Amazon-Guard-Duty-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Guard Duty Basic Features"></a>Amazon Guard Duty Basic Features</h1><p>Amazon GuardDuty is an intelligent threat detection service that provides you with an accurate way to consistently monitor and protect your AWS accounts and workloads for suspicious activity. We’re talking about intelligent threat identification for your accounts, data, and workflows. It uses trained machine learning models to identify suspicious user and resource behaviors. It also learns from your environment to eliminate false positive identifications.</p>
<p>Amazon GuardDuty is able to analyze CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS query logs to identify issues worth looking into. An interesting item about GuardDuty is that sample findings help you analyze the type of results that GuardDuty delivers. When you generate sample findings, GuardDuty populates your current findings list with one sample finding of each type.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, GuardDuty is able to display its results to AWS Security Hub. Generating sample findings will allow you to verify AWS Security Hub’s functionality sooner more than later. Let’s take a look at some sample results from the GuardDuty screens. As a result, Amazon GuardDuty gives you a listing of findings classified under three categories, low, medium, and high severity.</p>
<p>In this screen of the AWS console, low severity findings are marked in blue with a small circle next to the finding. Medium severity findings are marked by GuardDuty in orange with a small square next to the finding. High severity findings are marked by GuardDuty in red with a small triangle next to the finding. Also notice how, on the top right, you have a findings summary showing the total for each of the severity categories.</p>
<h1 id="Amazon-Macie-Basic-Features"><a href="#Amazon-Macie-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Macie Basic Features"></a>Amazon Macie Basic Features</h1><p>Amazon Macie uses machine learning to do its work and helps you discover and analyze sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 buckets, including personal identifiable information, or PII, such as names, addresses, credit card numbers, API Keys, and access credentials among many others. Macie scans S3 buckets and recognizes critical private information. It also automatically tracks changes to buckets and only evaluates new or modified objects in future scans. That way, it doesn’t have to review objects that have not changed and makes the discovery job significantly more efficient and scalable. You can run one-time or automated data discovery and display the results to AWS Security Hub.</p>
<p>Amazon Macie provides a list of findings where the severity and finding type are clearly displayed. In this case, we created a bucket called academy-ca-macie and uploaded a file with disabled user keys, an RDS SQL Query, a credit card list in CSV format, and a few other files. Notice the severity as medium or high. Also, notice the finding type for the S3 objects include Personal, Financial, and Credentials. It also points to the resource that is affected. Finally, it shows when the object was last scanned. In the future, unless there is a change, these objects will not be re-evaluated.</p>
