<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hello, and welcome to this course on Billing, Pricing, and Support in AWS, where we’re here to help you on your journey to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Danny Jessee, and I am one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS – Amazon Web Services – and AWS certifications. In this course, the AWS team will be presenting a series of lectures that introduce some Billing, Pricing, and Support resources currently available in AWS that may be covered on the exam. Feel free to contact me with any questions using the details shown on the screen, or you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>, where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.</p>
<p>This course has been specifically curated to help you pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and is ideal for anyone who is looking to learn more about the various Billing, Pricing, and Support resources in AWS in preparation for the exam. Passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a great first step for anyone looking to grow within their current career, or transition to a new career entirely.</p>
<p>The objective of this course is to provide a high-level introduction to important Billing, Pricing, and Support resources in AWS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Cost Management tools such as Cost Explorer and AWS Cost and Usage Reports;</li>
<li>The role of tags in cost allocation; and</li>
<li>AWS customer support resources and support plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>These objectives are covered by Domain 4 in the official AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam blueprint: Billing and Pricing, which accounts for 16% of the exam content.

<h1 id="Cloud-Economics-Basics-Part-One"><a href="#Cloud-Economics-Basics-Part-One" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Economics Basics Part One"></a>Cloud Economics Basics Part One</h1><p>Welcome to your very first Lecture “Understand how AWS Billing works.” Here we’ll give you the basics you need to understand AWS Billing.</p>
<p>We take you on a journey through the development from the classic data center to today’s public cloud. </p>
<p>In addition to important information about the modern Cloud Economy, we also show you the problems with the Public Cloud. </p>
<p>Cloud costs affect everyone, so it is important that IT, Finance, and Executive Departments understand each other. We convey the most important terminology from these areas and ensure mutual understanding. </p>
<p>Even though we are fans of practical learning, this will be a theoretical lesson to lay the foundations for the rest of the course.</p>
<p>Please join me into the first lecture.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at where we actually come from. Until the year 2006, companies still relied on their own IT. IT costs were fixed, also called Capital Expenses or CapEx. </p>
<p>That has changed with the move to the cloud. IT and cloud costs are now much more variable and difficult to plan than before. We have moved to operational expenses, also known as OpEx. No worries if you don’t know exactly what these terms mean, we’ll cover them later.</p>
<p>We are currently at a tipping point where more is already being spent on cloud resources than on-premise. And the trend is rising. Forecasts predict that by 2022 we will have a total cloud spend of around 360 billion dollars.</p>
<p>In addition to many advantages, the cloud also has its downsides and we can see what these are in this graphic. At re:Invent 2019 310 business and IT executives were asked where their biggest problems lie in cloud operations. </p>
<p>The graphic speaks for itself, 29% stated that cost management is their biggest challenge. </p>
<p>This is still underpinned by a survey by Gartner. According to the survey, 80% of companies will overrun their Infrastructure as a service budget in 2020. </p>
<p>Reason enough to bring the knowledge about cloud cost optimization to the world, right?</p>
<p>Working in the Cloud comes with many benefits and variable expense control. However, due to the often new and unfamiliar environment, many users end up with paying more and struggling with cost management.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Cost-Optimization-Matters"><a href="#Why-Cost-Optimization-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Cost Optimization Matters"></a>Why Cost Optimization Matters</h1><p>Starting early with cost optimization is essential and can save a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Many AWS cost projects do not start when you migrate to AWS, but costs get out of hand. And then it usually becomes even more difficult to change entrenched processes and behaviors. But do not be discouraged by this if you are in such a situation. This is why we have created this course, to help you relax, even in such difficult situations.</p>
<p>AWS offers fantastic opportunities for faster development, lower TCO, and increased agility.</p>
<p>No matter if a startup or large corporation, AWS grows with the requirements and always provides exactly the services that are currently needed - of course, only when used correctly.</p>
<p>Cost Optimization helps you meet your financial and business objectives while only paying for what you need and and use.</p>
<p>AWS is not a traditional data center and therefore should not be used as such. </p>
<p>AWS allows us to be much more agile and instead of spending time on administrative overhead, we can invest that time in innovation.</p>
<p>Companies see the greatest potential for savings by taking advantage of the agility of AWS and developing applications that scale and are highly automated.</p>
<p>Later in the course, we will cover the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework, clarifying the key concepts and design principles of cloud workloads.</p>
<p>Cost optimization will help you manage your resources and money appropriately and in time to make economically wise decisions before expenses get out of hand and need to be fixed.</p>
<h1 id="Cloud-Economics-Basics-Part-Two"><a href="#Cloud-Economics-Basics-Part-Two" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Economics Basics Part Two"></a>Cloud Economics Basics Part Two</h1><p>Welcome to the section about the basics of cloud economics. The value of cloud extends beyond cost savings for your infrastructure. Cloud users can see significant improvements in other areas, including staff productivity, operational resilience, and business agility.</p>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper into cloud economics to see what exactly is part of it, and where companies can improve their business. Of course, there’s cost savings or a lower TCO. Or in other words, infrastructure cost savings, or avoidance, from moving to the cloud. This can be reached through: A better ability to match supply and demand, and improving utilization; Elastic cost base driven by usage patterns; And through the elimination of hardware refresh and maintenance programs. Example for this is 50% reduction to total TCO.</p>
<p>Then there’s also the staff productivity, or efficiency improvement by function on a task-by-task basis. This can be reached through a higher maintenance efficiency through automation, the elimination of hardware-related tasks, and increased developer productivity. An example for this would be over 500 hours per year of server configuration time saved.</p>
<p>There’s also operational resilience, or the benefit of improved availability, security, and compliance. This can be reached through the reduced cost of planned and unplanned outages, a reduced risk profile, or cost of risk mitigation, and an improved service level agreement. And an example for this is the critical workload that is run in multiple AZs and Regions for strong disaster recovery.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is business agility, or the faster deployment of new features and applications, while reducing errors. And this is reached through reduced time to market, increased operational agility, and the reduce costs, and increased pace of innovation. An example for this is a 75% faster launch of a new product.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at some real numbers to see what this means exactly. In 2018, IDC, one of the largest market research firms in the world, asked 27 major corporations how their use of AWS has impacted their business. And as we can see here, they had a 62% more efficient IT infrastructure staff, nearly three times more features delivered, and 94% less time lost to unplanned downtime.</p>
<p>This is of course only a sample of 27 companies. And of course, the perspectives are not supplied everywhere. But you get a good overview of what is possible when using cloud properly. Cloud economics is not only about cost savings. However, with the right usage the cloud can help your entire business become more efficient.</p>
<p>In the past, engineering teams needed the approval of the finance team to get new resources. This process works, but it’s incredibly slow, and would destroy all of the agility in the cloud. So how can this process be adapted to the cloud? The biggest hurdle here is not to get financial issues in the way of IT teams, and to involve financial teams in planning, procurement, and forecasting.</p>
<p>Based on many companies’ experience, AWS has created a high-level best practice framework that is also called the five pillars of cost optimization. The five cost optimization pillars apply, regardless of your workload or infrastructure across nearly all environments.</p>
<p>The pillars of cost optimization are defined by AWS as follows:</p>
<p>Right-sizing: Ensure that what you provision matches what you need. For example, for compute, you provision for CPU, memory, storage, and network throughput.</p>
<p>Increase elasticity: Traditional IT costs and hardware requirements are tailored for peak usage and are rarely turned off. In the cloud, you can optimize costs to meet dynamic needs and turn resources off when they are not needed. For example, you can usually turn off non-production instances for 70% or more of any given week.</p>
<p>Leverage the right pricing model: AWS provides a range of pricing models. For example, On-Demand and Spot Instances for variable workloads, and Reserved Instances for predictable workloads. Choose the right pricing model to optimize costs based on the nature of your workload.</p>
<p>Optimize storage: AWS provides multiple storage tiers at prices designed to meet performance. By identifying the most appropriate destination for specific data types, you can reduce Amazon Elastic Block Store and Amazon Simple Storage Service while maintaining the required performance and availability. For example, where performance requirements are lower, using Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD typically cost half as much as the default General Purpose SSD.</p>
<p>Measure, monitor, and improve: To ensure that you extract the full economic potential of the AWS Cloud at any scale, you want to: Define and enforce cost allocation tagging. And you will hear me talking about tagging a lot within this course.</p>
<p>Forecast usage and costs: Define metric set targets and review at a reasonable cadence. Enable teams to architect for costs via training, visualization of progress goals, and a balance of incentives, and assign optimization responsibility to an individual or to a team.</p>
<h1 id="Total-Cost-of-Ownership"><a href="#Total-Cost-of-Ownership" class="headerlink" title="Total Cost of Ownership"></a>Total Cost of Ownership</h1><p>Welcome to this section about TCO or Total Cost of Ownership. TCO was already mentioned a few times. TCO stands for Total cost of ownership and is a comprehensive assessment of IT’s total costs or other costs over time.</p>
<p>For IT, TCO includes hardware and software acquisition, management and support, communications, end-user expenses, and the opportunity cost of downtime, training, and other productivity losses.</p>
<p>Comparing the TCO of different environments is not an easy task. Especially in the “old world,” the on-premise world, many factors play a role in this assessment, as this overview shows.</p>
<p>Let’s take the facility costs for example. Something like space, power, cooling. It’s nothing you have to worry about when using AWS resources. </p>
<p>Using the cloud has greatly simplified the TCO assessment.</p>
<p>Because most additional costs are included in AWS’s service prices, there are far fewer factors to take into account.</p>
<p>As someone who started his IT career by assembling servers and configuring switches, I can assure you that physical IT operation involves a lot of effort, costs, and stress.</p>
<p>Today, an EC2 instance can be started with just a few clicks; in the past, a server had to be assembled, installed, mounted in the data center, and wired. Also, there were costs for maintenance, cooling, space, power, licenses, and other factors.</p>
<p>Understanding TCO improves the overview on the business and helps you recognize issues and opportunities at an early stage.</p>
<h1 id="Economies-of-Scale"><a href="#Economies-of-Scale" class="headerlink" title="Economies of Scale"></a>Economies of Scale</h1><h1 id="Welcome-to-this-section-about-economies-of-scale-Every-time-you-attend-AWS-Re-Invent-the-largest-AWS-conference-worldwide-you-can-see-this-slide"><a href="#Welcome-to-this-section-about-economies-of-scale-Every-time-you-attend-AWS-Re-Invent-the-largest-AWS-conference-worldwide-you-can-see-this-slide" class="headerlink" title="Welcome to this section about economies of scale. Every time you attend AWS Re:Invent, the largest AWS conference worldwide, you can see this slide."></a>Welcome to this section about economies of scale. Every time you attend AWS Re:Invent, the largest AWS conference worldwide, you can see this slide.</h1><p>The only thing that changes every year is the number of price reductions. Currently, this number is 69. </p>
<p>How does AWS manage to reduce prices continuously?</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple: Economies of scale. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at this cycle. More customers lead to higher AWS usage which leads to more infrastructure. The economies of scale effect occurs because costs can now be spread over a larger number of customers. The infrastructure becomes cheaper, prices can be reduced and new customers benefit from the lower prices. And then the cycle starts all over again. </p>
<p>With AWS you’re likely to experience lower prices over time as their infrastructure grows and the economies of scale takes place.</p>
<h1 id="Pricing-Calculator"><a href="#Pricing-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Pricing Calculator"></a>Pricing Calculator</h1><p>With the AWS Pricing Calculator, you have a powerful tool to estimate costs, reduce running expenses and find the cheaper, better suited solution for your environment. Welcome to the section about the AWS Pricing Calculator.</p>
<p>The Pricing Calculator has undergone many name changes and innovations over the years. The current version as of fall 2020 is a great help to estimate the total cost of your AWS environment, find the right instance sizes and compare services across different regions.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at how the tools work exactly. When you generate an estimate, you can either add services directly to your estimate or create a group and add the services to your group. This time I will show to set up a group with an Amazon EC2 instance that you can use to perform tasks, such as, run a small program or host a website.</p>
<p>We’ll now create an estimate and assign it to a region. So we click on, Create Estimate and we need to look up the service we’re looking for. Wanna estimate an EC2 instance, so we’re looking here for EC2 and click on, Configure. We have to choose a region.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, every region has a different pricing. There are cheaper and there are more expensive regions. We will take Frankfurt as this is where I’m sitting currently. You can either create quick estimate or an advanced estimate. We will go for the advanced estimate, because this gives us the option to also choose the kind of workload that we have.</p>
<p>Let’s assume we have an online blog and we have many users or visitors over the weekends. So we choose daily spike traffic. And we assume that we have a lot of visitors on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have a baseline of, let’s say, three instances and during peak times over the weekend, we have 10. Peak times are eight hours and we need to find an instance.</p>
<p>Let’s say we need two CPUs and four gig of RAM and the tool tells us which instance would be the cheapest, as you can see here. Let’s say we take the t3a. The A stands for an AMD chip set. We can see we have four gigs of memory. Two CPUs. Enough network traffic. And that’s good enough.</p>
<p>Here you can choose the pricing models. We will cover this later within the course. So we’ll just go for On-Demand here. 10 gigs of storage is enough. Daily, two daily snapshots. We also have some data transfer. Let’s say, 10 gigs. Intra-region transfer, no. Outbound, yeah, let’s say also 10 gigs, just to get some numbers in here. And you can see here, we would have EC2 costs monthly of 72 and some storage costs of $50. </p>
<p>We have $87 total cost for our EC2 instance and bare in mind that we have a spikey workload. So these with these usage patterns are already calculated in here. We can now add this calculation to our estimate and see how much our website or our blog would cost us for 12 total months.</p>
<p>We could now save our estimate or add another service. For example, let’s say we also need a database, maybe like MySQL database. Notice that’s a huge instance here. Let’s go for a small one, m5.2xlarge. It’s also a big a one, but it’s just for numbers, right? On-Demand is fine. 20 gigs of storage.</p>
<p>Then we can see the database would cost us $592, plus a little bit of storage. We can also add this to our estimate and we can now see the total price here and so it goes on. You can add the services and tools that you need here and get a very accurate estimate for your total costs.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Well-Architected-Framework"><a href="#AWS-Well-Architected-Framework" class="headerlink" title="AWS Well-Architected Framework"></a>AWS Well-Architected Framework</h1><p>AWS has developed a structure of best practices and strategies when building software in the cloud, called the AWS Well-Architected Framework. </p>
<p>Based on knowledge collected and gained by AWS solution architects and AWS users over the past years it is made to provide strategies and proven concepts for cloud systems.</p>
<p>The framework is based on five pillars that ensure a secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective system.</p>
<p><strong>The 5 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework - Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>aims at constant improvement and efficient managing of workloads, as well as gaining operational insights and continuous improvement of processes and procedures to support business value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Security</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>describes how to protect data, systems, and components using cloud technologies, how user rights and privileges are correctly managed, and how integrity and conformity of information is maintained</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reliability</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>focuses on the ability of a workload to perform correctly and as intended at the expected time. Including quickly recovery and prevention from failures</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, AWS provides the AWS Well-Architected Tool, which is based on the framework‘s principals. The tool helps to review the user workloads and compare them to the latest architectural best practices.</p>
<p>In general, the AWS Well-Architected Framework and the tool act as general guidelines that can be used without additional costs.</p>
<p>As a user, you will benefit from free architectural guidance, proven and tested strategies, and best practices directly from AWS for your workloads.</p>
<p>By making use of the AWS Well-Architected Framework and its tool, you can avoid pitfalls and failures by relying on proven strategies and professional practices for your own system, without any additional costs. The framework guarantees you improvements on security, reliability, efficiency, and on the financial end.</p>
<h1 id="Working-with-the-Pillars-of-the-AWS-Well-Architected-Framework"><a href="#Working-with-the-Pillars-of-the-AWS-Well-Architected-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Working with the Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework"></a>Working with the Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework</h1><p>Striving for excellence by applying as many best practices as possible into the workloads, with the aim to reduce human error, save time and resources by automation and continually improve processes.</p>
<p>Principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operations-as-Code</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire workload, i.e., the development of applications together with the infrastructure, should consist exclusively of code. This way, operational errors can be reduced, and the execution, as well as updates or changes, can be automated, which saves time and resources.</p>
<ol>
<li>Frequent but small and reversible changes</li>
</ol>
<p>The development and infrastructure should be designed for small and light updates that are made more frequently and should be easily reversible if necessary, without breaking anything.</p>
<ol>
<li>Evolve procedures alongside the workload</li>
</ol>
<p>As software development progresses, so should the associated processes. Regular and dedicated routines can help to find improvement opportunities, like finding processes that can be automated, and validate the effectiveness of the procedures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Failure prevention</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify sources of failures and remove the cause before issues reoccur by performing preventive exercises. Regular events and simulated exercises will increase awareness inside the team and improve reaction times.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning from operational failures</li>
</ol>
<p>Every incident and failure is a lesson to analyze and learn from. Lessons and appropriate improvements should be well documented and shared throughout the whole company.</p>
<p>As customer needs and business demands can change rapidly, it is wise to design the development infrastructure to support agility and possible changes in advance. **<br>**</p>
<p>Additionally, keeping lessons on success and failure well documented and easily accessible helps maintain the best possible performance and reduce spending time on recurring decision-making.</p>
<p>That was the first pillar, operational excellence. The next one will be Security.</p>
<p>The goal of the security pillar is to provide the highest possible security on data, systems, and components.</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementation of a strong identity foundation</li>
</ol>
<p>Going by the principle of least privilege, users are granted only as much access as they need to fulfill a task. Appropriate authorization should be a major requirement for all resources in the cloud system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Traceability</li>
</ol>
<p>Real-time monitoring, alerting, and auditing actions and changes in the environment should be logged and made available for automatic investigation and action routines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply security at all levels</li>
</ol>
<p>Defensive strategies should be applied to all possible levels.</p>
<ol>
<li>Security by automation</li>
</ol>
<p>By using automated security mechanisms, architectures gain the ability to scale faster and more cost-effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data protection</li>
</ol>
<p>Make the use of data encryption, tokenization, and access control mandatory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Access</li>
</ol>
<p>Reduce the risk of improper handling or modification of sensitive data by users by preventing direct access when not needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Incident preparation</li>
</ol>
<p>Prepare incident management and investigation policy in advance to handle incidences when they occur.</p>
<p>When designing the system architecture, identity control, and access on multiple layers should be prioritized from the beginning to avoid major changes at a later state.</p>
<p>Recognize demand changes as well as disruptions at an early state to acquire resources in time and recover from failures automatically.</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatic recovery</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify potential outages by using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on the workload that will trigger the monitoring system. This allows you to take appropriate action to either prevent the outage or automatically begin remediation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Test recovery procedures</li>
</ol>
<p>Develop recovery strategies by testing different failure scenarios. Other than an On-Premise environment, the cloud allows simulating variously scaled scenarios.</p>
<ol>
<li>Horizontal scaling for better availability</li>
</ol>
<p>Prevent common points of failure by scaling the infrastructure horizontally, i.e., distributing requests across multiple resources rather than hoarding the entire workload on a single resource.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop guessing capacity</li>
</ol>
<p>Use monitoring as a tool to detect demand and scale the environment accordingly by automated addition or removal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manage changes in automation</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes to the infrastructure should only be made by automated and trackable actions.</p>
<p>Monitoring and logging is the fundament of a reliable system. By analyzing logged metric data and responding accordingly in time, failures can be detected beforehand and automatically repair themselves.</p>
<p>Efficient usage of computer resources to meet system requirements while demand and technological advances may change.**<br>**</p>
<ol>
<li>Make use of advanced technologies</li>
</ol>
<p>In times of cloud computing, many software solutions come as a service. Using software as a service instead of hosting, operating, and managing a tool provides more free time and resources for the development team.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global in minutes</li>
</ol>
<p>With AWS Regions, the workload can be deployed all around the world and at various scales, which allows the reduction of latency for customers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Serverless architectures</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, many traditional computing activities can be realized through serverless solutions that can be maintained without the need for a physical server, thus saving costs for operation, management, and operations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Experiment more</li>
</ol>
<p>Various tests can be performed with virtual resources to determine which service or resource and which type of configuration is best suited for individual requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the options - make the right choices</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure to get to know about the service that aligns best with individual workload goals. For example, when making decisions, consider the appropriate database or storage concept that best suits the needs.</p>
<p>Use a data-driven approach to select high-performance designs. Collect data on all areas of your architecture, monitor deviations from expected performance, and then take action.</p>
<p>Deliver business value at the lowest possible price. Reduce upfront fixed costs and profit from controllable and small ongoing expenses.</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement Cloud Financial Management</li>
</ol>
<p>Build capabilities to manage and spread awareness of costs and expenses in the cloud environment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt a consumption model</li>
</ol>
<p>Pay as you go. Analyze the actual business needs and match resources to current requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure overall efficiency</li>
</ol>
<p>Measure workload business performance and the costs associated with deployment. Use these metrics to determine the gains you make by increasing performance and reducing costs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop spending money on data center operations</li>
</ol>
<p>AWS takes over traditional data center tasks and does not charge extra to manage and update operating systems or applications with managed services. </p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze and attribute expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>AWS makes it easy to identify system usage and costs and transparently allocate IT costs to individual workload owners based on this data. This helps you measure return on sales (ROI) and enables workload owners to optimize resources and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Getting the best performance and value while spending as little as possible can be achieved by applying the whole AWS Well-Architected Framework correctly on the individual business and cloud environment. The most vital part is to spread awareness of expenses and correct resource usage across the team to get rid of inefficiency</p>
<h1 id="Understanding-the-Other-Departments"><a href="#Understanding-the-Other-Departments" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Other Departments"></a>Understanding the Other Departments</h1><p>Every department and every job has its own language. When people from different areas meet, communication is often difficult because important terms are not familiar to the other side.</p>
<p>Take the example of IT and finance. The topics of these two areas are far apart.</p>
<p>But as we have already learned, it is important to establish communication between these areas and this is exactly what we want to help you with in this lesson.</p>
<p>We will introduce you to the most important terms from AWS but also from software development and finance.</p>
<p>AWS has hundreds of different services and you can probably fill a whole dictionary with terms. Here we would like to explain the most important terms that are also important for the Cloud Financial Management area.</p>
<h1 id="General-AWS-Terminology"><a href="#General-AWS-Terminology" class="headerlink" title="General AWS Terminology"></a>General AWS Terminology</h1><p>Account (AWS) - AWS services are housed within an Account. Accounts can be Master Payer accounts that contain billing data or Linked Accounts which do not. AWS Organizations and other services can be used to manage Accounts within AWS. Many AWS services can span Account boundaries.</p>
<p>RI -Reserved Instance - a commitment to use a cloud resource, usually of a specific type, location, and size, for some period of time, usually 1 or 3 years, in exchange for a discounted rate.</p>
<p>SP - Savings Plans are very similar to Reserved Instances but more flexible and can only be applied to compute usage.</p>
<p>AURI, PURI, NURI &#x2F; SP (SavingsPlans)</p>
<p>All Upfront Reserved instance, Partial Upfront Reserved Instance and No Upfront Reserved Instance. Some people use these acronyms when referring to reserved instances, in case you hear them.</p>
<p>EC2 (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud AWS’ virtual computer cloud offering</p>
<p>AWS supports a variety of instance, Instance Type, Family, Generation, Size (AWS) - Instance refers to a specific EC2 virtual machine. Instance Families, designated by letter, an instance Generation designated by a number and optionally other letters, and instance sizes which follow a structure of nano, micro, small, medium, large, xlarge, 2xlarge, etc. The Instance type includes the entire ndesignation, such as m5a.4xlarge which would be an “m” family, 5th generation, “a” for AMD chipset, 4xlarge sized instance. </p>
<p>IAM - Identity and Access Management - is the way that AWS refer to their system of granting and governing permissions within their cloud platforms.</p>
<p>Tags are metadata attached to a specific ressource running in AWS. They are meant to provide contextual information about the resource. Tags can be created with the resource in most cases or added after the fact manually or systematically. Tags are useful for identifying the type of resource, the environment it supports, the owner, the cost center, etc. </p>
<p>Tags can be queried or accessed in a wide variety of ways and can be used to drive automation, divide costs, or for other important purposes. Most large cloud-using organizations will at some point establish governance policies around tag use and require specific tags be used on all resources.</p>
<p>Console</p>
<p>Web-based portal from where you can manage your accounts or access AWS services. </p>
<p>Convertible &#x2F; Standard</p>
<p>AWS terms referring to the ability to convert reserved instances for some resources to different specifications. Standard RIs cannot be converted or changed for their entire term. Convertibility reduces the discount offered by AWS.</p>
<p>Region </p>
<p>AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered. An AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZ’s within a geographic area. Regions are generally guaranteed to be more than a minimum distance from one another to satisfy disaster recovery requirements.</p>
<p>Availability Zones (AZ) are sub-units of a Region, there are typically multiple AZs per Region. AZs are made up of multiple physical data centers but can generally be thought of as being very closely situated from a network latency and performance perspective.</p>
<h1 id="Terminology-from-Software-Development-amp-Operations"><a href="#Terminology-from-Software-Development-amp-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Terminology from Software Development &amp; Operations"></a>Terminology from Software Development &amp; Operations</h1><p>You’ve probably heard this one here before: DevOps. DevOps is a set of practices that intends to break down traditional silos between developers and operators of computer systems, allowing combined teams to collaborate and deliver software in a more consistent, efficient and automated fashion.</p>
<p>Enterprise Architecture, or EA, groups are traditionally tasked with outlining the structure of the systems an enterprise will build and maintain to achieve its business goals. Like physical architects, they provide the blueprints for how the various systems should be put together, the “materials” or software concepts that should be used to build them, and how the end results should look.</p>
<p>Lift &amp; Shift. Lift &amp; Shift is a method of migration involving moving an application as currently architected and built from one environment (an on-premises data center) to another (usually a public cloud). Lift &amp; Shift migrations can usually be done more quickly as they often do not require substantial change to the application code or configuration.</p>
<p>However, because they do not modify applications to use cloud-native services, they tend to create situations where the cloud system is more expensive or difficult to run than the on-premises system had been. </p>
<p>Lift &amp; Shift migrations are typically used when time pressure to close a data center or other need outweighs the cost and quality issues. A remediation period for the environment should always be planned After a Lift &amp; Shift migration to address issues.</p>
<p>Workload is a generic name for an application or software system running on a computing or other platform.</p>
<p>In a traditional website, there might be a web server, an application server and a database server, each running on an individual hardware-based server, or virtual machine in my data center, each of those three elements of the application would be a workload running on that virtual server. </p>
<p>On-Premises (or On-Prem) is a term used to refer to company-owned or company-controlled data center space. Usually used to differentiate from public cloud environments where application migrations are targeting workloads.</p>
<p>Companies have an extensive On-premises infrastructure built over many years when they begin using the cloud, and there are often difficulties using systems, infrastructure or processes developed for the on-premises environment in the public cloud.</p>
<p>Rightsizing is a form of optimization where measurements are taken over time to match workloads to a virtual resource sized to run it efficiently with a minimum of waste. Rightsizing can be used as a technique to save costs but must always involve technology oversight as well.</p>
<p>Agile is a method of project management, used primarily for software development characterized by division of tasks to short phases of work (into sprints) and frequent assessment of priorities and plans. Generally, leads to development of products or software incrementally beginning with a minimum viable product and then continually enhancing it from a backlog of requirements.</p>
<h1 id="Terminology-from-the-Finance-amp-Accounting-World"><a href="#Terminology-from-the-Finance-amp-Accounting-World" class="headerlink" title="Terminology from the Finance &amp; Accounting World"></a>Terminology from the Finance &amp; Accounting World</h1><p>We are now getting to the last part of our terminology section, Now with terms from the finance and accounting world. And we’re starting with amortization. This means retiring a payment of capital gradually over time on a schedule which reflects the benefits the capital provides in each period. Like depreciation, amortization typically applies to the retirement of cash payments, where depreciation tends to apply to physical capital equipment. An upfront RI payment can be amortized over the usual lifetime (1 or 3 years) of the RI itself.</p>
<p>Variable Costs are costs that varies according to the business volume it supports. A company hosting websites would need to pay for more computers to host more websites, and so that cost per website is a variable cost.</p>
<p>Upfront Charges for Reserved instances or savings plans. Reserved instances or service reservations, in general, can typically be purchased with a full upfront payment (All Upfront), a partial upfront payment plus a reduced periodic charge (Partial-upfront), or with no upfront charge (No-Upfront). The upfront charge may be amortized over the life of the RI. Upfront charges might be treated as Prepaid Expenses on the Balance Sheet but check this with your accountants!</p>
<p>Opex or Operating Expenditure is a category of business expense made in a specific accounting period which provide benefits only in that accounting period. Purchasing on demand cloud services is considered an Operating Expenditure. Operating expenditures require no long-term tracking of depreciation or amortization but are subtracted from earnings in the period incurred.</p>
<p>ROI - Return on Investment is the amount of profit from an investment made, usually expressed as a percentage of the original total cost invested. In a cloud rightsizing business case, the ROI might be calculated as the savings in cloud expenditure expected less the engineering and other costs required to take the rightsizing action.</p>
<p>The Income Statement (sometimes referred to as a P&amp;L statement) is a statement showing the company’s net profit or loss over a period of time (a month, a quarter, a year, etc.) The income statement would show expenses and amortization incurred during the period, so in year two of a 3-year RI, the amortization for the second year would show up as an expense against earnings in the period covered.</p>
<p>NPV or Net Present Value. An assessment used to calculate the long-term profitability of a project made by adding together all the revenue it can be expected to achieve over its whole life and deducting all the costs involved, discounting both future costs and revenue at an appropriate rate. In a cloud business case, the net present value of all the cash flows of a no-upfront RI might be compared to the current cash value of the all upfront RI for determining which is better for the business.</p>
<p>Depreciation means retiring the cost of an asset gradually overtime on a schedule which reflects the provision of benefits. Often this reflects the decrease in value of an asset over time due to wear and tear or usefulness because of continued use in out periods.</p>
<p>EBITDA. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. An assessment of the earnings expected when subtracting only the cost of goods sold from the revenue achieved. Tracking the prepaid expenses of a 3-year all-upfront Reserved Instance as a cash outlay that can be amortized over three years would affect EBITDA differently than if the resources were purchased using cash at on-demand rates. </p>
<p>Capitalization is the ability to treat an investment or outlay as a capital item which will be depreciated or amortized in future periods. Cost Allocation is in FinOps, the ability to identify and allocate costs to the appropriate cost categories in use. Ideally direct costs, amortized costs, and shared costs can be allocated to individual budgeting categories for a clear view of the entire cost of running my application or workload in the cloud.</p>
<p>Unit Economics is the ability to directly compare my overall cost to the overall business benefit l am creating on a per unit basis. For example, if I understand that the overall cost of running my website infrastructure is $5Mil per month and is able to support 10,000,000 paid hosted web pages, then I can track a Webpage&#x2F;$ metric of “2” which indicates how efficiently I run my service. Any future modifications to my cloud infrastructure can then be expressed in terms of the Webpage&#x2F;$ metric to determine if they are helping or hurting, and opportunities for cost savings can be expressed in terms of how they impact Webpages&#x2F;$.</p>
<p>Fixed Cost. A cost which does not change with changes in business volume. The cost of a data center building mortgage is a fixed cost in that it does not vary regardless of whether there it is supporting 1 web server or 1,000,000 web servers driving the company’s revenue.</p>
<p>Balance Sheet. A statement of financial position of the business on a specific date which indicates the value of all assets and liabilities as of that date, including the retained value of any undepreciated or unamortized capitalizable items. A company purchasing a 3-year RiI at the beginning of a year would show that RI with % of its original value on the Balance Sheet on the last day of that year.</p>
<p>Capex Capital Expenditure - the purchase of a capitalizable asset, such as a building or equipment meant to provide value over a long term and thus to be depreciated or amortized over that term. Purchasing a data center and using it over 30 years is considered a Capital Expenditure while paying to run a virtual server in the cloud for this month is not.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You passed a heavy theoretical part and learned about the most important terms and their meanings in the cloud and finance context!</p>
<h1 id="Bills-and-Cost-Drivers"><a href="#Bills-and-Cost-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="Bills and Cost Drivers"></a>Bills and Cost Drivers</h1><p>Welcome to the first live demo. As you can see here we are in the AWS Management Console. The most fundamental part is to get a good overview of the environment. Therefore you have to get a broad view of all the services, usage, and expenses from the past, and the present.</p>
<p>To set a base for our analysis, we first need to get some numbers. For this we will be using the billing dashboard which is also our main platform for gathering information on expenses. We will deal a lot with the billing and cost management dashboard alongside but the very first thing I like to investigate when I start with an unfamiliar account or environment is to check the last bills.</p>
<p>So to get there, you can either type bill here in the search field to get straight to the billing service or you can just go here over the menu to the billing dashboard. Here, you get a good first overview what is going on in your account. What are the most expensive services? How much have you spent so far? And what is the forecast? The forecast to the current month. But we will talk about this later.</p>
<p>So first thing here is the bill section here on the left side. I wanna get to overview from the last month, how much we spent last month and what were the biggest cost drivers. So as we are currently in January 2021, I go one month back to December 2020, here from the dropdown menu. And as you can see, I have a total amount, how much we spent last month.</p>
<p>I have like different information about taxes and payment summaries. And I can also get a CSV file from my whole bill or just printed as a PDF. So as you can see here we are in a master payer account, that means we’re using AWS Organizations which enables us to link other accounts to this account.</p>
<p>So all the costs that are caused by the under linked accounts are covered by this account that are collected here. You can see there are many accounts but let’s focus on this overview here. So what I wanna get here is the first overview. What are the most expensive services, or like what are the biggest cost drivers.</p>
<p>You can see we’re spending like small amounts, like compared to the total we’re spending small amounts on like different services. For example, here $34 for the API Gateway or 91 for CloudFront. As this is like just like a very very small percentage of our total amount, it would make no sense or like almost no sense to dive into deeper analysis here for CloudFront. It just would make no sense because like the amounts are here so small and this makes also like our whole analysis much easier because we know the only thing we have to focus is Elastic Compute Cloud because this is the biggest cost driver in this case. And when we go here, we can see, okay, we’re using like quite a lot of regions here.</p>
<p>So my first question would be, why do we need so many regions? And as you probably know, the regions in Asia are way more expensive than for example, the regions in Northern Virginia. So my first question would be, why do we have all these different regions? And as you can see this is like just my thinking process, how I would approach such an analysis or such an optimization process but we will talk about this later in detail. Let’s go through the next section.</p>
<h1 id="Credits"><a href="#Credits" class="headerlink" title="Credits"></a>Credits</h1><p>AWS credits are applied to bills to help cover costs that are associated with eligible services. They are applied until they are exhausted or they expire. With credits AWS introduced a sort of reward system for particularly active users and developers. You can use them instead of spending money on certain services.</p>
<p>So you may ask yourself, “How do I get credits?” So, there are multiple ways. For example, developing and publishing a skill for Alexa or by attending webinars and events. As a startup, you can use the AWS Activate program or through the AWS Credit Program for Nonprofits.</p>
<p>In my case, let’s jump here to the credits section, I did a few AWS certifications, and for that I was rewarded by AWS with two $300 credit vouchers which is pretty cool. I used them here for my private account to play around with a few services that I was interested in and as you can see here, you can see a list of which these credits can be applied to. And there are almost all services that are available for AWS. And what’s quite funny is, the AWS cost explorer that can also cost money when you are using the API is not listed here. So, for the billing services and the cost services you can’t use these credits.</p>
<h1 id="Cost-Explorer"><a href="#Cost-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Cost Explorer"></a>Cost Explorer</h1><p>In this section, we will take a look on how to use the AWS Cost Explorer, one of the most essential tools for our Cloud Financial Management within AWS. Moreover, the Cost Explorer is the very main tool for you to gather information and analyze all the costs and expenses in your environment. So let me introduce you to the tool itself.</p>
<p>To get there, you can go over to your Billing Dashboard. From here, go to the Cost Explorer, and just launch it. See, you’re getting guided to a whole new menu where you can start to analyze your costs. The Cost Explorer is a built-in tool that lets you get deeper insights into the costs and usage of your cloud environment.</p>
<p>With the help of the Cost Explorer, you will be able to identify trends, hunt down the biggest cost drivers and detect anomalies. And the best part, the Cost Explorer, in its base variation, does not cost anything. You can use it for free. However, take note that there can be additional costs when you use tools to request the API of the Cost Explorer.</p>
<p>Every API request costs about one cent, which could drive up your costs very fast when you fire up a lot of API requests. With the Cost Explorer, you can visualize your usage patterns over time and identify underlying cost drivers.</p>
<p>What we see here is the very first view that you get when you open the Cost Explorer. It is grouped by the different services that you use. You get a six-month overview, and the visualization type is bar, which means that the costs are stacked to each other in these kind of bars here. You can also change this to stacks or to lines, what doesn’t make too much sense in this case. So let’s stick to the bar view.</p>
<p>The legend here below shows you which service is illustrated by which color. In this example, we can see over the last six months our EC2 usage has increased quite a lot. If you scroll down a little bit you can see the detailed data table. Below the Cost Explorer here is the data table, which provides a deeper insight into the data seen in your chart. And you can also export this as a CSV file for further processing with a table tool like Excel if you wanna make forecasts or like further analysis. </p>
<p>You can also like, like I said we have the last six months here, you can also like scroll vertically to see all the services and cost drivers and you can scroll horizontally to see each month. It’s basically just a table.</p>
<p>You can choose the exact timeframe you want to see within Cost Explorer. By default, it’s on six months. So you can either select day by day that you wanna see or you can choose to auto select here to see for example like just last seven days, current month, three months, six months, one year, months to date, year to date, or three months forecast or 12 months forecast.</p>
<p>Let’s go for the last seven days here. So we can see how much we spend for the day different services day by day. We can also delete the group by filter here and get like monthly view. It makes no sense because we wanna see days. So you’re gonna select daily here and then we can see how much we spend day by day, if there’s, for example, an anomaly. We can see, oh wow, like way more than the other days. Why is that?</p>
<p>You can see we are here January 1st the first day of the month. And on the first day of the months, you usually have to pay for tags, reserved instances, and all that stuff that incurred like more costs than over the other days. And that could be the explanation for this anomally here.</p>
<p>And you may have noticed you can also go from a daily to an hourly view, but it is deactivated. I can’t select it. Why is that? The reason for that is super easy. You have to pay for the hourly view because you need like much more data records. So you have to enable it first. If you really wanna go in that much detail. I will show you how you can do this.</p>
<p>Hourly view, you have to go to preferences. And this is the point we are looking for, the hourly and resource level data. We can select this and save it. Here you can also see the cost that would occur. And we can see here one cent per 1000 usage records per month.</p>
<p>It depends how much EC2 instances because this just applies to EC2. It depends how much EC2 instances you’re running. Of course, the more instances you’re running the more usage records you are going to record and the more costs you incur, but 1 cent per 1000 records, in this case, it’s not that much. </p>
<p>So we wanna save it here, go back to the Cost Explorer and we can see, oh, the hourly view is available. We can only see last 14 days of usage was the hourly view enabled. In this case because I just enabled it, I won’t see anything because the data needs to be recorded first. So it will take a minimum of four days for Cost Explorer to collect enough data that the hourly view is available here.</p>
<p>About data grouping and filter. We started with the group function, with the grouped by functionality, you can segment your data based on a particular cost or usage. For example, you can choose a region to see in what region you spent the most money on which regions you spent money.</p>
<p>Let’s go with a bar so we can see, let’s take December. We spent the most money in Ireland followed by others because others mean we have like a lot of data here. Well, let’s go to December. We’ve used many different regions here and all the regions that we use that are not shown here are combined into the others bar. If you want to stripe your chart down to make it more granular, you should use the filter function located on the right.</p>
<p>Using the filter panel. You can refine your data set to include or exclude specific filtering dimensions and values. For example, let’s say we wanna only see costs that occurred in Frankfurt. We go to the filter section here search for the Frankfurt region, select it, applied it, then we can just see the costs that applied for the Frankfurt region. And we can use like many combinations here to dive deep within our costs.</p>
<p>For example, if we just wanna see the costs for our EC2 instances, just filter here for EC2, for our compute instances. Nothing else just compute instances.</p>
<p>So just our literal service and we filter it by instance type and then we can see what instances occurred the most. So for example, here, we have a G4DN which is like a graphical, a big graphical instance that is quite expensive in this case.</p>
<p>As you can see here on the right, there are quite a lot of filters that you can use and no worries, we won’t look at all of them, but some of them are quite interesting. Let’s for example talk about usage type, usage types are the unit that each service uses to measure the usage of a specific type of resource.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanna know how long my t2 micro instances we are running in the past, I would just type in here, t2 micro, oops micro, select a filter here. And I can see my t2 micro instances were running 370 hours in July and about 200 hours in August. And you can use this for many other services as well.</p>
<p>Usage type groups also is pretty cool, these are the kind of type of filters that collect a specific category of usage type filter and put it into one. For example, if I wanna know how long all my EC2 instances were running in the past, I would just search for EC2 running hours and I could see the amount all my EC2 instances were running over the last six months.</p>
<p>Another one that is quite useful if you wanna go in more detail is the filter for API operations. So let’s take S3 as an example, we can see here. We don’t have that much S3 costs here, just in December $188. But if I wanna know more about these costs, how these costs are structured, I can look for specific API operations that apply to S3.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to know how much my costs were for like reading files from my S3 three buckets, I would look up GetObject because this is the API operation for reading objects from S3. I apply this filter here and it can see the costs for GetObject from S3. That’s it, that’s how you’re gonna use API operations.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there are a lot of API operations that are used within AWS and I can highly recommend to have a look at API reference documentation for each service because you can see here, this is like just for S3, all the API operations that you can use for S3. And just by looking at them, you can, for most of them, you can already like kind of guess what they’re doing. Like for example, here, create object, create bucket and you can like just look forward for the API operation that fits for your kind of analysis.</p>
<p>A little bit deeper into Cost Explorer and the advanced options that can also be quite useful. For example, show only untagged resources. This is a pretty important filter because we talk about tags already a lot and little spoiler here we will talk about them way more because this is such a super, super, super important topic. And if you set this filter here you will see all the resources that have no tags attached, super important to see that.</p>
<p>What is also quite cool is the show costs as here. The unblended filter here will be the best for the vast majority of AWS customers. This is the cost dataset presented you on the bill page like for the bills and for the invoices. And it’s also the default option for analyzing costs using AWS Cost Explorer or setting the custom budgets using AWS budgets.</p>
<p>The unblended costs represent your usage costs on the day that they are charged to you or in finance terms they represent your costs on a cash basis of accounting. For most of you this is the only data set that you will ever need. Okay?</p>
<p>Amortized costs are also quite interesting because the amortized cost is useful in cases in which it doesn’t make sense to view your costs on the day that they were charged or as many of finance owners say it’s useful to view costs on an actual basis rather than a cash basis.</p>
<p>This cost dataset is especially useful for those of you who have purchased AWS or reservations such as reserved instances or savings plans. Savings plans and reservations often have upfront or recurring monthly fees associated with them.</p>
<p>Recurrent fees for reservations are charged on the first day of the month that can lead to a spike on one day if you’re using unblended costs as your cost dataset. When you toggle over to amortized costs, these recurring costs, as well as any upfront costs, are distributed evenly across the month.</p>
<p>Armotised costs are a powerful tool if you seek to gain insight into the effective daily costs associated with your reservation portfolio, or when you are looking for an easy way to normalize costs and usage information when operating at scale.</p>
<p>And then there are also like, two more that can be quite helpful. And these are the net unblended costs and the net amortized costs. These are basically the same as the two that I just explained here but they also include discounts like the reserved instance volume discounts. Like these discounts are calculated into these costs.</p>
<h1 id="Reports"><a href="#Reports" class="headerlink" title="Reports"></a>Reports</h1><p>Let’s talk about reports. Reports can be super, super, super useful. For example, in this case, I build a specific view for EC2 instances running in Frankfurt, in the EU region on a monthly base, like on a base for December, in this case. And because I wanna use this view more often, I can save it as a report. And to do this, I just click here on save as. I give this one a title, EU-EC2. I save it, and that’s it.</p>
<p>By clicking here, on recent reports, I can see this report. Or I can just go under report overview and see all the reports that I have here. The reports with a lock here are default AWS reports, and the one without a lock are my own reports.</p>
<p>Some of the AWS reports can be pretty useful. For example, what I use quite a lot is the RI utilization and coverage, or the savings plan utilization and coverage, that basically shows you how effective or efficient your reservations are.</p>
<h1 id="Cost-and-Usage-Reports"><a href="#Cost-and-Usage-Reports" class="headerlink" title="Cost and Usage Reports"></a>Cost and Usage Reports</h1><p>The AWS Cost and Usage Reports or in short the CUR. The CUR is basically the most important thing to capture your AWS billing data. And the CUR is a pretty complex CSV file that stores all details about your cost and usage data of all AWS resources.</p>
<p>Enabling the CUR is super important because it’s the most granular and detailed mechanism to collect data for AWS costs and usage. It offers historical by-the-hour data that can offer clarity on trends and lead to a more accurate data-driven insight. And there’s no looking back. Until the CUR is enabled, you’re losing valuable data about your usage that is older than 12 months.</p>
<p>The CUR can get really big and in large corporations, it can easily get beyond five gigabyte and more with millions over millions of lines. So let’s see how to enable them.</p>
<p>When we are here in the AWS Management Console, we click here on the top menu on the billing dashboard and you can see here on the left menu for the Cost and Usage Report. By default it’s disabled so you need to enable it, enable it first and create a report. We give it a name. Let’s call it test. I would advise you to include the resource IDs because then, every resource get a unique resource ID.</p>
<p>You can enable the automatic refresh. Click Next and then you need to choose an S3 bucket where you put the file. This can either be existing an S3 or a new one. Then we set a path, a prefix pass task costs. You can select the time granularity here. Of course, the more granular the data are, the more data you’re going to produce.</p>
<p>We can create new report versions or we can override the existing ones and we can choose what kind of data integration we need.</p>
<p>And a little side note here maybe. You can export the files for Redshift or QuickSight usage. This will change the output format of the file to be readable for either Athena or Redshift and QuickSight. See, Athena is Parquet and Redshift or QuickSight is the CSV file that comes in a, in a zip file.</p>
<p>With Athena, Athena is a serverless service that allows you to analyze the data stored directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. And for that you need, as I just mentioned, the Parquet file While with Redshift and QuickSight, you can manage to see a SWI file as you would do it also like for example, for Excel.</p>
<p>Redshift is a so-called data warehouse service which you would use for querying big data sets with like multiple gigabytes or even up to petabytes. It can help you take wide insights of your own environment and for customers on a very large scale. And QuickSight is a business intelligence service that can combine data from literally any source into a dashboard. It helps you to visualize for any type of audience and it is much more visually driven than Athena or Redshift.</p>
<p>After you set up all these options here, you can click on Next and that’s basically it. You have now configured your Cost and Usage Report. But be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for the first report to be delivered. Also, expect some costs from S3 for storing the CUR data in your S3 bucket. But these costs are like very, very low. Maybe like, I don’t know, a few dollars per months or per year. Depends on how big your file gets of course.</p>
<h1 id="Budgets"><a href="#Budgets" class="headerlink" title="Budgets"></a>Budgets</h1><p>In this section, we will learn how to create a budget, to help manage running expenses. Budgets allow the user to get notified when costs or usage exceed a certain predefined amount. So let’s have look how to set up automatic notifications and actions with AWS Budgets.</p>
<p>So we get there by clicking here on the top menu on the billing dashboard. Here on the left, we have budgets, we click on it, and we can see that there is already a budget predefined here. I set this up in the past to get notified if my monthly budget threshold gets over $150 but let’s create a new budget.</p>
<p>So we can select four different kinds of budgets in this case or like in general. We have cost budgets based on actual costs, usage budgets based on usage like ours and budgets for reserved instances and savings plans. So let’s start with the cost budget.</p>
<p>So first we need to give it a name and we have to select a period in that we want to be notified. We will keep it here on a monthly period and we can also choose if this is a recurring budget or an expiring budget. Does that goes, for example, like just till April but we will stay with a recurrent budget.</p>
<p>So you can either choose if you want to set a fixed budget. Like for example, last month I had costs of $31. I can set this to $35 ‘cause this is quite close. And if I would like reach this threshold here I would get notified. You can also set a monthly budget planning.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have a snowboard rental and you know, there won’t be much users on your platform in the warmer month, like for example, in April till October. So you could set the budget here to like just 100 bucks. But you know, in the cooler months when there’s actually actually snow, you will have much, much more users. So you could set a budget here to 1000 bucks but let’s keep it simple and go with a fixed budget.</p>
<p>You have fear like also many other photos that you also know from the cost explorer demo. The last demo that I just showed you to get more information about the costs you had in the previous months. But let’s configure the thresholds.</p>
<p>You can define your budget thresholds and you can set it either to the actual costs like the cost that like actually occurred to a percentage, like an alert threshold for example, like 80%. So in this case, you would get an alert if 80% of the budget that we just defined in the last step, if we reach this threshold. That will be $28 in this case. And you could also set it based on forecast at cost but this is getting too complex.</p>
<p>Let’s keep it with the actual cost. So here, can you set up the notifications. I can like type in here, my email address and whenever I would reach the threshold I would get an email an alarm that I reached this threshold. And since October 2020, it is also possible to set different kinds of triggers for actions like budget actions. These are based either on identity and access management policies, service control policies or you can also target running instances like EC2 or RDS.</p>
<p>For example, you can choose to apply a custom denied EC2, run instance IAM policy to a user, to a group or to a role in your account once your monthly budget for EC2 has been exceeded. With the same budget threshold, you can configure a second action that targets specific EC2 instances, using a particular region. You can choose to execute actions automatically or make use of a workflow approval process before AWS Budgets execute a request on your behalf.</p>
<p>It’s possible to set up five budget thresholds with up to 10 actions for each threshold. IAM and SEP action type reset at the beginning of each budgeted period. Like in our case, monthly while actions target at a specific EC2 or RDS running instances will not reset.</p>
<p>So we’ve clicked here on the budget actions we activated it, and now we can choose an IAM role that allows budget actions to actually do something with the instances that we are going to define here. So let’s just take this open access role that have defined earlier and we can also choose what should happen.</p>
<p>We can say here if our threshold reaches the budget that we just defined, just stop all EC2 or RDS instances. This is of course, like quite radical step but if you are on a budget, well, you have to do what you have to do, right? So when you can choose if you want to stop EC2 or RDS instances, and you can also select a specific region where this should happen. And if I would click here on “Confirm budget,” the budget would be set. And if the threshold is reached, I would get an email and my EC2 instances would be stepped.</p>
<h1 id="Tagging"><a href="#Tagging" class="headerlink" title="Tagging"></a>Tagging</h1><p>The essence of a cost allocation strategy is the ability to tell how much is spent on which resource on which service. This type of visibility can be best achieved by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/aws-cost-management-tagging-1696/introduction/">tagging</a> every single resource in your cloud. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> enables the user to put tags on every available resource. You can use tags for many things. But for this course, we’re just going to focus on how to use them for cost allocation. So let’s find out what tags actually are. </p>
<p>Tags provide the functionality to define metadata in the form of key and value pairs. These on the other hand are associated with the resources in a cloud account. Let’s have a look at this diagram. In this example, we’re looking at four resources. Don’t mind the details because it doesn’t really matter what kind of resources they are. These are just some key samples. So each of them has a tag, which goes by the key-value environment production. This one is true for every four of them. This means that all of these resources belongs to the production stage of our environment.</p>
<p>The next one distinguishes our resources between the frontend and backend, and basically tells us right away which resources host a front-end service and which hosts a back-end service. Typically, business tags such as cost center, business unit, or project are used to associate AWS costs with traditional financial reporting within an organization. However, a cost allocation report is not static and hence can include any tag. This allows customers to easily link costs to technical or security dimensions, such as specific applications, environments, or compliance programs.</p>
<p>With AWS Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Report, AWS costs can even be viewed according to tags, providing even more insightful cost visualizations. AWS Cost and Usage report is otherwise known as AWS CUR. Just so you know what the Cost and Usage Report is, I wanted to drop in a short explanation. With the help of AWS Cost and Usage reports, you can track the monthly AWS costs and usage associated with your AWS account. The report includes items for each unique combination of product, usage type, and operation that is used in your AWS environment. It enables you to configure the AWS Cost and Usage report to show only the data that you want, using the AWS Cost and Usage API.</p>
<p>AWS Cost and Usage Reports contain the widest variety of cost and usage data. You can set up the CUR to collect billing data for any given period and push it into an Amazon S3 bucket to store it there for whenever you need it. You can get hourly, daily, or monthly reports. These contain the costs in detail and are sorted by product or resource. If tags are used properly, they are also listed in the report and can provide extra detail to your bill. A report is updated at least once per day and up to three times. They can be stored in an S3 bucket of your choice and be retrieved whenever needed, either manually or by using another service. </p>
<p>After you set up a cost and usage report, you receive the current month’s billing data and daily updates in the same Amazon S3 bucket. The data from the CUR forms the base for a detailed and complete cost analysis. It is often the main part for many business intelligence tools, like Athena and QuickSight, just to name a few. And CUR can also be reached by an API, which you can use for your custom scripts or individual needs.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, with AWS CUR, you are able to store your report files in Amazon S3 buckets, update the report automatically, up to three times a day, make use of the AWS CUR API for automation or easier management through API calls, and use the CUR for in-depth analysis with business intelligence tools like QuickSight, Athena, and others. That’s about it for the AWS Cost and Usage Reports, so let’s continue. </p>
<p>Keeping cost allocation in mind, the best way to assign business-context details to specific resources is by using tags. Later on in the process, this enables you to carry out a more valuable analysis based on your cost data and facilitates company-specific decision making by a well-evaluated foundation of data. If you take bill analysis into consideration, tags can add business dimension and context to ease the allocation process. </p>
<p>Tags are used to identify which item or resource in your cloud is attributed to each of your business services. So you can always tell exactly which resources are used for which service in your company. Nevertheless, keep in mind that tags are only meaningful to their respective user or a customer. They literally do not have any semantic meaning. You can name them whatever you like and assign a value to them. However, when used correctly, they can help read and analyze your data and even automate your analysis with the right setup.</p>
<p>In AWS, you can manage tags in the service console or accessing the API through AWS CLI, although this limits you to only one resource at a time. If you want to add, edit, or delete tags on multiple resources, it is best to use a service, for example, the AWS Tag editor. Once you have tagged your resources, you can enable Cost Allocation Tags in the Billing and Cost Management sections. We will discuss how to tag and activate the Cost Allocation tags in a minute. One significant thing to note here is that tagging existing resources retroactively is pretty annoying. So make sure to tag your resources from the very beginning.</p>
<p>In the best case, policies can prohibit the deployment of new resources without the appropriate tags. But more about that later. If you want to analyze a cost report after the fact with unlabeled or poorly labeled resources, you will have a hard time understanding the exact usage of each resource, and will likely not be able to identify the exact costs and usage by resource. So, it is advised to start tagging resources as soon as possible and stay consistent with your tagging strategy.</p>
<p>Planning out a tagging strategy or a tagging standard is essential, and the best time to implement one is before a company launches its cloud resources. It’s best to keep tagging simple and easy to grasp. Don’t overdo it for the sake of it. After all, you want to gain visibility, not cause confusion. The best thing to do is to learn about predefined tags and choose the ones suitable for your business. It’s also advisable to adjust your tags to follow your KPIs once you determine them.</p>
<h1 id="Tagging-Best-Practices"><a href="#Tagging-Best-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Tagging Best Practices"></a>Tagging Best Practices</h1><p>We’ve picked a few best practice examples for you to apply for your business or organization. Let’s start with some common tags that are used by most organizations. Of course, these are just some ideas and you need to use tags that fit your business case. Some common examples include Cost Center or Business Unit tag, used to show where resource costs are allocated within the organization, and it also allows correct cost allocation within billing data.</p>
<p>Service&#x2F;Workload name tag. This shows which service the resource belongs to. Resource Owner tag. This is responsible for the resource. Simple Resource Name tag. This is something easier to read and to remember than the default tags. And Environment tag. It determines the cost difference between different environments. For example, dev, test&#x2F;stage, production. Check your cloud and see whether these tags can help you get started with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/aws-cost-management-tagging-1696/tagging/">tagging</a>. Also make sure to check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> pre-generated tags. They might save you some time.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at some tagging best practices. So, number one, align tags to your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/aws-cost-management-tagging-1696/aws-generated-cost-allocation-tags/">cost allocation strategy</a>. Before you start tagging, you should think of a general cost management strategy. Think of tags that help you to track and allocate expenses and make those tags align with your strategy. Next, tag everything. Tag as many resources as possible so that no resource is left untagged. Make this a rule. In fact, you can roll out policies in your cloud environment that will forbid launching resources without tags.</p>
<p>Next, find a purpose for each tag. Think of a certain use case before adding a tag. Otherwise you will have a hard time justifying your tags and you risk running into a mess of baseless tags. That now leads me onto the next point. Limit the number of tags you adopt. Find redundancies and overlapping tags and simplify them. There’s no point in releasing multiple tags that cover the same subject. Look for tags that might logically overlap. See where you might merge them and reduce the number of your overall tags. And keep it manageable. Obviously, the more tags you have, the more tags you have to deal with. Keep the number as low as necessary, but the information value as high as possible.</p>
<p>Next, consistency is key. Use a consistent naming convention. This helps to keep an overview and eases further processing. Giving your tags less abstract names, and instead naming them with descriptive terms also makes them easier to read. Automate tag management. Make use of tools like the AWS tag editor to automate your tagging. Avoid wasting time on repetitive tasks and use automation as much as possible. Set up policies to forbid launching untagged resources. This is an easy way to ensure that no new resources are slipping into your environment without a tag.</p>
<p>And finally, audit and maintain your tags. Make it a habit to review tags from time to time and verify their purpose. Tag maintenance is essential and should involve everyone on the team. So make it a recurring task for everyone and have everyone keep their eyes open for suggestions for improvement.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Generated-Cost-Allocation-Tags"><a href="#AWS-Generated-Cost-Allocation-Tags" class="headerlink" title="AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags"></a>AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags</h1><p>The default tags in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/amazon-web-services/">AWS</a> are basically cost allocation tags. They can be activated in the billing section, which we will explain in a minute. Cost allocation tags are special tags that are used by Cost Explorer and other services for allocation and visualization. So they can be explicitly used and displayed in the various views of various services. So take a look at the screenshot. Here we can see the Cost allocation tags section in AWS Billing. We can tell that CostCenter and Name are active and enabled as cost allocation tags, while the others are inactive. These inactive tags were once set for resources that are not in use any longer.</p>
<p>Once the cost allocation tags are activated, the console detects all tag keys used and suggests those for activation as cost allocation tags as well. Otherwise, they won’t show up in Cost Explorer charts. The term User Defined means that a user created these tags and that they are therefore custom tags. AWS generated tags were automatically generated, such as createdBy, the createdBy Amazon WorkSpaces Tag. These were created and applied to support AWS resources for the purpose of cost allocation. They can only be view in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and reports. They do not appear anywhere else in the AWS console, including the AWS Tag Editor.</p>
<p>Also, note that in this Cost allocation tags section, all the tag keys that are and were used in the account will be shown here. However, if you don’t enable the Cost Allocation Tags option, you will not be able to evaluate certain views in the Cost Explorer and other services. For example, if I want to know what costs have been incurred for all resources with a specific cost allocation tag, then I won’t be able to select or see them.</p>
<p>To prevent you from failing to find your resources with those cost allocation tags, I will show you how to enable this option. Let’s see how you can enable AWS generated Cost allocation tags. First, you need to log in to your Master account as an IAM user with the required permissions. Next, type Billing into the search field and go to the Billing console. Select Cost Allocation Tags on the left side menu. And then, simply click on Activate to enable the tags.</p>
