        <h1 id="Course-Introduction"><a href="#Course-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Course Introduction"></a>Course Introduction</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Implementing Azure Backup. My name is Thomas Mitchell and I’ll be taking you through this course.</p>
<p>I’m an Azure instructor at Cloud Academy and I have over 25 years of IT experience, several of those with cloud technologies. If you have any questions about this course, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or send an email to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#x75;&#100;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#x75;&#100;&#97;&#99;&#97;&#x64;&#101;&#109;&#x79;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>. This course is intended for those who wish to learn about Azure Backup. </p>
<p>We’ll kick things off by taking an introductory look at Azure Backup, where you’ll learn what it is and what it does. You’ll also learn what workloads can be protected with Azure Backup. After you’ve been introduced to Azure Backup, we’ll take a look at how it works. You’ll learn about Recovery Services vaults, Backup vaults, and about backup data redundancy options. We’ll also cover the different backup types that are available.</p>
<p>Once you’ve learned how Azure Backup works, we’ll take a look at Backup Center, where you’ll learn how to use it to manage Azure Backups. Coming down the home stretch, we’ll take a look at Azure Backup policies, where you’ll learn why you use them and how to configure them.</p>
<p>We’ll round things out with a few Azure Backup demonstrations. After finishing this course, you’ll come away with an understanding of what Azure Backup is, what it offers, and how to implement it.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. If you’re ready to learn about Azure Backup, let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="An-Introduction-to-Azure-Backup"><a href="#An-Introduction-to-Azure-Backup" class="headerlink" title="An Introduction to Azure Backup"></a>An Introduction to Azure Backup</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Azure Backup. In this lesson, we are going to take a look at what Azure Backup is, and at what it can backup.</p>
<p>Azure Backup, as you might expect, is Microsoft’s cloud-based backup solution that requires no infrastructure to implement. Azure Backup allows you to perform one-off backups and scheduled backups through the use of backup policies. </p>
<p>You can use Azure Backup to protect many different workloads, including Azure VMs, Azure Managed Disks, SQL Server in Azure VMs, and SAP HANA databases in Azure VMs. You can also use Azure Backup to protect Azure Files Shares, Azure Blobs, and on-prem files, folders, and system state.</p>
<p>Because it’s a zero-infrastructure backup solution, Azure Backup requires no capital expenditures. Its single pane of glass streamlines backups by allowing you to discover, govern, monitor, and manage backups right from the backup portal. Over the next few lessons, we’ll take a look at some of the key aspects of the Azure Backup offering.</p>
<h1 id="How-Azure-Backup-Works"><a href="#How-Azure-Backup-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Azure Backup Works"></a>How Azure Backup Works</h1><p>So, how does Azure Backup work? Well, for starters, Azure Backup consists of a few different layers, or pieces. You have the Workload Integration Layer, the Data Plane, and the Management Plane. The Data Plane is actually broken out into two pieces: “Access Tiers” and “Availability and Security”.</p>
<p>The Workload Integration layer is where the integration of the backup extension and the workload being backed up happens. The Access Tiers within the Data Plane define where backups are stored. These access tiers include the Snapshot Tier, the Standard Tier, and then Archive Tier. The Availability and Security piece of the Data Plane defines where backup data is replicated. The redundancy options chosen by the user will determine if the backup data is replicated across zones, or regions, or both. And the Management Plane is where the Recovery Service vaults, Backup Vaults, and Backup Center sit. These tools allow you to interact with the backup service.</p>
<p>Whether it’s data, machine state, or workloads running on on-prem machines or on VMs, it’s all backed up to the cloud and stored in either a Recovery Services Vault or a Backup Vault. Backup Vaults support Azure Database for PostgreSQL server backups, Azure blob backups, and backups of Azure disks. Recovery Services Vaults support everything else, including VM backups, SQL in Azure VMs, Azure Files, SAP HANA in Azure VMs, Azure Backup Server backups, backups via Azure Backup Agents, and DPM.</p>
<p>Regardless of which type of vault you use; the vault is used to organize backup data and it allow you to monitor your backed up items. Access to Recovery Services Vaults and Backup Vaults is controlled by Azure RBAC.</p>
<p>When you backup to a vault, you need to specify how the data in the vault is replicated, because the replication you choose determines how redundant your backup data is. You have a few different choices. You have locally redundant storage, or LRS; you have GRS, or geo-redundant storage; and you have zone-redundant storage, or ZRS.</p>
<p>Locally redundant storage protects backup data from server rack failures and drive failures in Azure. LRS replicates the backed-up data three times with a single data center within the primary region.</p>
<p>Geo-redundant storage protect data against region-wide outages by replicating that data to a secondary region.</p>
<p>Zone-redundant storage replicates backup data in availability zones. This guarantees data residency and resiliency in the same region. I should mention that recovery services vaults use geo-redundant storage by default.</p>
<p>If you need to back up on-prem Windows machines, you can use the MARS agent to backup directly to Azure, right over the internet. The long name for the MARS agent is Azure Backup Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent. You can also backup on-prem Windows machines to a backup server like System Center Data Protection Manager, or DPM, or a Microsoft Azure Backup Server, or MABS. In these cases, you would then backup the backup server to a Recovery Services Vault in Azure. I should point out that on-prem Linux machines are not supported by Azure Backup.</p>
<p>Azure VMs can be backed up directly to Azure via the backup extension that Azure Backup installs on Azure VMs. The backup extension allows you to perform a backup of the entire VM. However, if you only need to backup files and folders on a VM, you can use the MARS agent instead.</p>
<p>Azure Backup supports full backups and incremental backups. It also supports Full, Differential, and Transaction Log SQL Server backups. The table on your screen breaks down the differences between the types of backups supported by Azure Backup:</p>
<p>Notice that all backup types, including MARS agent backups, Azure VM backups and backups performed via DPM and MABS all go to a vault. What’s also important to note here is that all backup types also support incremental backups. </p>
<p>In the next lesson, we’ll take a look at the Azure Backup Center.</p>
<h1 id="Getting-Started-with-the-Azure-Backup-Center"><a href="#Getting-Started-with-the-Azure-Backup-Center" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started with the Azure Backup Center"></a>Getting Started with the Azure Backup Center</h1><p>Welcome to Backup Center! In this lesson, we’ll take a quick look at what Backup Center is and when it can be used.</p>
<p>Azure Backup Center is designed to be a single pane of glass where organizations can manage their backups at scale. It’s designed in a way that makes it especially useful in large and distributed Azure environments. The Backup Center allows you to manage backups for many different workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and even Azure Lighthouse tenants.</p>
<p>Because of its Datasource-centric design, Backup center can provide views and filters that focus on data sources that are being backed up. For example, if you make use of resource tags in your Azure environment, you can filter your views in Backup center so that you see the backup information for only the resources that are tagged with a specific resource tag. This helps filter out “noise”.</p>
<p>Now, I do need to mention here that the Backup Center only supports certain resource backups. The resource backups supported include Azure VM backups, SQL in Azure VM backups, SAP HANA in Azure VM backups, Azure Files backups, Azure Blobs backups, Azure Managed Disks backups, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server backups.</p>
<p>On the screen here is a view of what Azure Backup looks like. The Overview page is the default page you see when you open the Backup Center. It displays existing backup jobs, backup instances, and active alerts.</p>
<p>The Jobs tab, or pane, provides a summary of all backup and restore jobs within the last 24 hours. You can view information on the number of jobs that have completed, failed, and are in-progress. Clicking on View All, or on any of the numbers provides more information on the jobs listed.</p>
<p>The Backup Instances tile provides a summary of all backup instances that you’ve configured. Clicking on the numbers in this pane provides additional information on the backup instances for a particular data source type and protection state. </p>
<p>And then, of course, the Alerts pane shows any pertinent alerts. The left navigation pane provides you with the ability to manage your backup instances, vaults, and policies, and it allows you to monitor your backups and view backup reports. You can also configure compliance and Azure policies for backup.</p>
<p> In the next lesson, we’ll take a look at Azure Backup policies.</p>
<h1 id="Azure-Backup-Policies"><a href="#Azure-Backup-Policies" class="headerlink" title="Azure Backup Policies"></a>Azure Backup Policies</h1><p>Welcome back. In this lesson, we’re just going to take a quick look at backup policies.</p>
<p>As with any other backup solution, ongoing backups in Azure are managed via backup policies. You can create backup policies for Azure VMs, SQL in Azure VMs, SAP HANA in Azure VMs, and Azure file shares. However, if you want to just backup files and folders using the MARS agent, the policy for backing up these items is specified in the MARS console.</p>
<p>Backup policies are created on a “per vault” basis and each policy that you create can be assigned to multiple resources. For example, an Azure VM backup policy is typically used to protect multiple Azure virtual machines.</p>
<p>When you create a backup policy in Azure Backup, you have to configure the policy schedule and the retention settings for the policy. The policy schedule, of course, specifies when to take the backup, while retention defines how long each backup should be retained.</p>
<p>When configuring a backup policy’s schedule, you can select a daily schedule or a weekly schedule with a specific point of time. Retention can be configured for “daily”, “weekly”, “monthly”, and “yearly” backup points. Retention for “monthly” and “yearly” backup points is considered Long Term Retention, or LTR.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that when you create a Recovery Services Vault, a default policy is also created automatically. You can use the default policy to backup your resources, or you can create your own policy as you see fit. The image you see on your screen shows what the default policy looks like when you create a Recovery Services Vault:</p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson, where I’ll show you how to create a backup policy.</p>
<h1 id="Creating-an-Azure-Backup-Policy-Demo"><a href="#Creating-an-Azure-Backup-Policy-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Creating an Azure Backup Policy Demo"></a>Creating an Azure Backup Policy Demo</h1><p>Hello and welcome back. On the screen here you can see I’m logged into my Azure portal. And what we’re going to do here is create a basic backup policy in one of our recovery services vaults. </p>
<p>Now to do this, from this screen here, I can either select a recovery services vault from my Recent resources list, or I could search for it, or I can select Recovery Services vault. What we’ll do here is we’ll just select the ‘Berk’sBatteriesRecovery’ here. And once we’re in the Recovery Services vault, if we scroll down here to the bottom, where it says Manage, we can see we have our Backup Policies option here. We’ll go ahead and select that, and what this is going to do is bring up any Backup Policies that are configured for this vault. And you’ll notice here we already have an hourly log backup on my daily policy for file shares, a default policy for the Azure Virtual Machines, and another policy I’ve configured called FileShareBackups for Azure file shares. </p>
<p>What I’m going to do here is just create a new policy called My Policy, just to walk you through the process of creating a Backup Policy in Azure Backup. So, what we’ll do here is click ‘Add,’ and then the very first thing we have to do here is select the policy type that we want to create. We have the SAP HANA, SQL server Azure file share, or Azure Virtual Machine. What we’ll do here is we’ll select ‘Azure Virtual Machine’, and then once we do that, we have to provide some information, we need to provide a Policy name, we need to specify the Backup schedule, Recovery Snapshots for instant restore, the retention range, and then any Azure Backup resource groups that uses optional here which we won’t use. </p>
<p>So, what we’ll do here is we’ll just call this MyPolicy. And then in frequency here we can select daily or weekly. We’ll just leave this at daily. And the time here we’ll set it to back up at 8:00 PM. And of course you can select the time zone here. See if I can find eastern time here anywhere. There we go, Eastern time. And if we hover over the icon for Instant Restore, what this tells us is this setting allows us to configure how to retain snapshots along with the discs for a faster restore. If we hover over the icon here, we can see what this tells us is when we configure the retained setting for the instant recovery snapshots, it tells us that at the latest snapshot is the only instant restore available. It’s going to be retained until the next successful Backup completes, regardless of what the retention setting is here. We’ll just change this to three days. So, basically this allows us to get an instant recovery for up to three days using a Recovery Snapshot. And then we have the retention for our daily backup points. We’ll leave this at the default for 180 days.</p>
<p>So, basically the daily backups is going to be kept for essentially six months, 180 days. And what we’ll do here is we’ll change the retention of our weekly backup points. We’ll set this to eight weeks, we’ll say. And then we can configure the monthly backup retention. And again, what this tells us is it runs on the first Sunday of the month. And it’s retained for 60 months. And of course, we have the retention of yearly backups, and we’ll just save this for seven years, we’ll say. </p>
<p>Now, you’ll notice in this message here tells us that Azure Backup is going to create a separate resource group to store our instant recovery points of our managed VMS. Now, it uses a default naming convention of Azure Backup RG and then the geography with a number appended to it. Down here we can actually change that and specify the Azure Backup resource group. As I mentioned, this is optional. So, we’ll just allow this to use the default naming convention. And if we’re happy with our settings here, we can go ahead and create the policy. And if we click ‘Go to Resource,’ go to ‘Backup policies.’ </p>
<p>We now have MyPolicy, that’s configured for Azure Virtual machine backups. Now, if we select associated items, we can see there’s nothing that this is associated with now, because we’re not doing any backups yet. We’ll go through a demonstration shortly, that will show you how to create a Virtual Machine Backup using this policy.</p>
<h1 id="Backing-up-a-VM-from-the-Azure-Portal-Demo"><a href="#Backing-up-a-VM-from-the-Azure-Portal-Demo" class="headerlink" title="Backing up a VM from the Azure Portal Demo"></a>Backing up a VM from the Azure Portal Demo</h1><p>Hello and welcome back. So, in the previous demonstration, I showed you how to create a backup policy. And now what we’re going to do here in this demonstration is a backup a virtual machine from the portal. </p>
<p>On the screen here, I’m in my Azure home screen. And what I’m going to do here is select this ‘DC01’ Virtual Machine. And if I select this guy here, there’s a couple of different things I can do. If I scroll down, if I select ‘Backup’ here under Operations from this VM, I can select an ‘Existing Recovery Services Vault’ or I can create a new one. I can also create a new policy or choose an existing policy. </p>
<p>What we’re going to do here is select an existing vault. You’ll notice here we have the two vaults here. I did build my policy in the BerksBatteriesRecovery vault. So, we’ll select that one. And then in the dropdown here, we can see MyPolicy that I created earlier. So, we’ll go ahead and select ‘MyPolicy’. And when I do that, what it’s going to do is give me some feedback on the backup policy details. It’s going to give me the Backup Frequency, the Instant Restore information, and the Retention of the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly backup points. And with those settings reviewed, what we do here is simply click ‘Enable Backup’. </p>
<p>And what it does is submit the deployment. And while this is doing its thing, we’ll go into the BerksBatteriesRecovery vault. We’ll go into Backup. And what we could do here is configure our backup here. But instead, what we’ll do here is go into Backup policies. And if we select ‘MyPolicy’ here, we go Associated items, we can now see that we have DC01 associated with this policy. Remember, when we first created the policy, there was nothing associated with it. </p>
<p>But now at this point, we have a VM that we can backup or actually we are backing up with this policy called MyPolicy. The Last Backup Status is in warning state. And it’s basically telling us that the initial backup hasn’t started yet. This will actually run the first backup based on the policy settings, which I think was 8:00 pm. So, that is how you backup a VM with a backup policy in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Congratulations! You’ve come to the end of the course. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We kicked things off by taking an introductory look at Azure Backup, where you learned what it is and what it does. You also learned what workloads can be protected with Azure Backup.</p>
<p>After the introduction to Azure Backup, we took a look at how it works. You learned about Recovery Services vaults, Backup vaults, and about backup data redundancy options. We also covered the different backup types that are available.</p>
<p>After learning how Azure Backup works, you learned about Backup Center, and how to use it to manage Azure Backups.</p>
<p>Coming down the home stretch, we took a look at Azure Backup policies, where you learned why you use them and how to configure them. We rounded things out with some demonstrations.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have a good understanding of what Azure Backup is, what it does, and how to use it. To learn more about Azure Backup, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy because we’re always publishing new ones. </p>
<p>Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As always, thanks for watching and happy learning!</p>
