<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to Managing Role-Based Access Control on Azure. My name is Eric Leonard and I’ll be leading you through this course. I’m a Microsoft Azure MVP and an Azure content author at Cloud Academy. I have over 15 years of experience in IT, several of those working with cloud technologies in the public and private sectors. If you have a question, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a message, or send an email to <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#99;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#x63;&#x61;&#100;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#116;&#64;&#99;&#x6c;&#111;&#117;&#x64;&#97;&#x63;&#x61;&#100;&#101;&#x6d;&#x79;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>. Who should take this course? This course is intended for people who want to take the AZ-101 exam to become a certified Azure administrator, or for people who are tasked with administrating Azure resources and security.</p>
<p>To get the most from this course, you should have a general understanding of the Azure portal. We’ll begin the course by touching on an overview of managing role-based access control on Azure. We will then work through how we configure access to Azure resources, create custom roles, and finally go over some troubleshooting steps. By the end of this course, you should be able to configure and assign the appropriate role-based access controls. We would love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you are finished. So if you are ready to learn more about managing role-based access control, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>RBAC provides fine-grained access management to your resources in Azure. What this does is it allows you to segregate duties between different teams in your organization. As an example, one team could be tasked with managing VMs and a subscription, or someone could be tasked with cost management, or give your IT security team access to Azure Security Center. Making these RBAC examples work is by creating role assignments. Role assignments define how you can access resources in Azure. This can be at the management group level and all the way down to the resource itself. A role assignment consists of three elements, the security principal, the role definition, and the scope you apply it to. A security principal can be a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that requires access to Azure resources. A role definition is a list of actions that you can or cannot do. Your role definition could allow you to create and manage virtual machines but prevent you from deleting them. </p>
<p>The following are the most common or known RBAC roles. Owner provides full access to resources in Azure, and you can delegate access to other users. Contributor, just like the owner role, provides full access to resources in Azure, but you cannot delegate control. As the name implies, the reader can only view resources in Azure. And lastly, the user access administrator role is granted permission to manage access to Azure resources. Beyond these fundamental roles, Azure provides many built-in roles to meet your organization needs. As an example, the security admin role provides access to Azure Security Center, where they can read, edit security policies, and view and dismiss alerts. The last element is scope. In Azure, the RBAC roles can be assigned at different levels depending on how wide you want to provide access. Scope can be applied at the management group level, or at the subscription, or at the resource group, all the way down to individual resources. Combining these three elements makes the role assignments work by defining the role definition it will apply to a security principal and then is assigned to a scope.</p>
<h1 id="Configure-Access-to-Azure-Resources"><a href="#Configure-Access-to-Azure-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Configure Access to Azure Resources"></a>Configure Access to Azure Resources</h1><p>Role-based access control is how you can manage access to resources in Azure. As you navigate through Azure, from the management group, subscription, resource group all the way down to the individual resources, you will notice a blade called Access Control IAM. This is where you can view, add and remove role assignments. Let’s go to the Azure portal and see how we can view, add and remove these role assignments. Here we are in the Azure portal under Resource Groups. Let’s select our resource group and we will notice that we have a virtual machine that is already deployed. Let’s give access to Ari as he is tasked with managing all virtual machines in this resource group. Click on Access Control. To add a role assignment, we can add it by clicking on the Add button on the right-hand side or we can hit the Add Role Assignment in the menu bar. Under Role, we will see a list of all the built-in roles possible. And we’ll scroll all the way down to Virtual Machine Contributor. In the Select field, we can search for Ari’s name, select his name and hit Save. Now Ari has access to this user’s group and to manage the virtual machine. </p>
<p>We can check Ari’s access by typing in his name. And here we’ll see the results of the access that he has. We can close that. As well as you can go to Role Assignments. Here we’ll see all of the role assignments for the resource group. Some of them are inherited and Ari is at the bottom, we’re a virtual machine contributor for this resource group. We can remove Ari’s access by selecting his user and clicking Remove. In this short demo, we added our user, Ari, to the virtual machine contributor role. We then verified his access by going to Check Access and reviewed the Role Assignments tab. We then finished off by removing the role assignment to the resource group.</p>
<h1 id="Activity-Logs"><a href="#Activity-Logs" class="headerlink" title="Activity Logs"></a>Activity Logs</h1><p>The Azure Activity Log provides visibility into subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. Using the Activity Log, you can determine what operations were taken on the resources in your subscription. The Activity Log has eight categories. Administrative. This will contain all the records for create, update, delete, and actions operations performed. Here we will see events related to RBAC like create role assignment and delete role assignment. Service health. Service health will contain any health-related events that affect Azure. Resource health will contain the records of any resource health events that have occurred to your deployed resources in Azure. Alerts will contain all the alerts that were activated. Autoscale will include the records related to autoscaling. Recommendations. This will have the recommendations from Azure Advisor. </p>
<p>Security, which will contain all of the logs generated by Azure Security Center. And finally, policy. The policy will contain records of all effect actions performed by Azure Policy. The Azure Activity Log only retains records for the last 90 days, and if you need to keep them longer for auditing or compliance reasons, you will need to use an Azure Event Hub to send your logs to your security information and event management application or archive the records in an Azure storage account. For Role-Based Access Control, the Azure Activity Log will log any changes made to role assignments or role definitions in your subscription. The events will be recorded as create role assignment, delete role assignment, create or update custom role definition, and delete custom role definition.</p>
<h1 id="Custom-Roles"><a href="#Custom-Roles" class="headerlink" title="Custom Roles"></a>Custom Roles</h1><p>Create a custom role for RBAC. Azure has many built-in roles that cover most of the needs for any team, but sometimes those built-in roles don’t cut it. You can create your own custom role to meet those needs. Custom roles can be created using Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI or the REST API. For this demonstration we will use the Azure Cloud Shell to create a custom role using Azure CLI. Here we are back in the Azure portal, where we will create a custom role. To start we need to go to the Azure Cloud Shell. We can open the Cloud Shell by selecting the Cloud Shell icon at the top of the page, or we can open a new tab and go to shell.azure.com. We will be creating a custom role called Virtual Machine Operator. Let’s open Visual Studio Code and look at our custom role. Our template is broken down into several sections. We have the name of the custom role, then we have the IsCustom, which indicates that this is a custom role. We have the description, which provides a short description of the role so others can understand what this custom role does. Action, which specifies what you’re allowed to do. NotActions, which is to deny actions. And AssignableScope, this is where we will list our scope for our custom role. </p>
<p>Let’s apply the custom role to the subscription. Type in AZ role definition create dash dash role definition and the name of the file, which is vmoperator.json, and hit Enter. After we have applied the command we can go back to the Azure portal, where we will select our resource group and go to Access control, Roles and scroll to the bottom to find our Virtual Machine Operator custom role. You will notice that the icon is different to easily indicate that this is a custom role. If during your testing of the new custom role, you notice that the role cannot do a certain action, you can return to your role definition and add the missing action. In this instance we will allow the role the ability to schedule shutdowns. We will add the Microsoft.DevTestLab&#x2F;schedules. We will then save the file and then we’ll type AZ role definition update dash dash role-definition and the name of the file. If the custom role is no longer needed you can delete it by typing AZ role definition delete name and provide the name of the custom role. In summary, we looked at a custom role definition and reviewed all the sections. We then created a new custom role, updated the role and then deleted the roll as we no longer needed it.</p>
<h1 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h1><p>Role-based access control changes in Azure don’t always go as planned. Let’s look at some scenarios where you may encounter issues. Scenario one. You can’t create a new resource in a resource group. Check access control to verify the user has the appropriate role assignment. If the user is part of a custom role, verify that the role definition can deploy that resource. Scenario two. You attempt to add a role assignment in your subscription and you receive an error role assignment limit exceeded. In your subscription, there is a limit of 2,000 role assignments. If you see this error, consider assigning roles to groups instead of individual users. Scenario three. You attempt to create or update a custom role but you get an error. Confirm that the user has the Microsoft.Authorization&#x2F;roleDefinition&#x2F;write permission. Scenario four. You attempt to create a new custom role and you receive an error role definition limit exceeded. In your tenant, there is a limit of 2,000 custom roles. Scenario five. You make a change in Access Control or you add a custom role and the changes do not reflect in the portal or in the console. Sometimes these changes can take time to take effect. You can log out and re-log in to force the refresh.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>I hope you enjoyed learning about managing role-based access control on Azure. Let’s review what you learned in this course. RBAC provides fine-grained access management to your resources in Azure. A role assignment consists of three elements, the security principal, that’s the user group, service principal, or managed identity. Then we have the role definition, that’s the role definition which is a list of actions that you can or cannot do and lastly, the scope that it applies to. We configured access to Azure resources by going to Access Control at the resource group level where we can also make these modifications at the management group, subscription or individual resource levels. In the resource group, we added a role assignment, checked the individual access, reviewed the role assignments and then removed the access. The Azure Activity Log provides visibility into subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. Using the Activity Log, you can determine what operations were taken on the resources in your subscription. </p>
<p>The RBAC events will be recorded as create role assignment, delete role assignment, create or update custom role definition and delete custom role definition. Activity logs are kept for only 90 days and if you need them for auditing or compliance reasons, you will need to export your logs using an event hub or a storage account. Custom roles can be created in Azure to meet the necessary requirements. You can use the Azure Cloud Shell with Azure CLI or PowerShell to create, update and delete role definitions. Adding role assignments or creating custom roles in Azure can lead to configuration errors. We reviewed some common scenarios in troubleshooting RBAC. To learn more about managing role-based access, be sure to read Microsoft’s documentation. Be sure to also watch for new Microsoft Azure courses on Cloud Academy because we’re always publishing new courses. Please give this course a rating. If you have any questions or comments, please let us know. Thanks for watching and happy learning.</p>
