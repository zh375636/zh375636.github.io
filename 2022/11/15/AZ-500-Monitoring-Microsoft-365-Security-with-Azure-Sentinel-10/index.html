<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Monitoring Microsoft 365 Security with Azure Sentinel. My name is Thomas Mitchell and I’ll be taking you through this course.</p>
<p>I’m an Azure and Microsoft 365 instructor at cloud Academy and I have over 25 years of IT experience, several of those with cloud technologies. If you have any questions about this course, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@cloudacademy.com">support@cloudacademy.com</a>.</p>
<p>This course is intended for those who wish to learn what Azure Sentinel is and how to use it to monitor Microsoft 365.</p>
<p>We’re going to start things off with an introductory look at what Azure Sentinel is and at what it offers. You’ll also learn how to onboard Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>We’ll then take a look at the process required for connecting Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365. You’ll also get to watch over my shoulder as I connect Azure Sentinel to Office 365.</p>
<p>After covering the onboarding of Azure Sentinel and the connection of Sentinel to Microsoft 365, we’ll look at how you can visualize data using Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>We’ll wrap things up by covering workbooks.</p>
<p>By the time you finish this course, you should have an understanding of how to onboard Azure Sentinel and how to connect it to Microsoft 365 and Office 365.</p>
<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this course, so please give it a rating when you’re finished. If you’re ready to learn about Azure Sentinel, let’s get started.</p>
<h1 id="Intro-to-Azure-Sentinel"><a href="#Intro-to-Azure-Sentinel" class="headerlink" title="Intro to Azure Sentinel"></a>Intro to Azure Sentinel</h1><p>Hello and welcome to intro to Azure Sentinel. Before we get into the meat of monitoring Microsoft 365 with Azure Sentinel, it makes sense to just touch on what Azure Sentinel is and what it offers.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management system, or SIEM. It’s also a security orchestration automated response solution, or SOAR. Essentially, what this means, is that Azure Sentinel can be used to collect and view security analytics data and threat intelligence data across your entire enterprise.</p>
<p>It allows you to detect previously undetected threats using Microsoft’s analytics and threat intelligence, and it allows you to investigate critical incidents using artificial intelligence. You can also use it to hunt down suspicious activities. And lastly, you can use Azure Sentinel to respond rapidly to incidents and you can automate protection of your environment.</p>
<p>Essentially, what Azure Sentinel offers, is the ability to improve your threat investigation and detection capabilities through the use of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>To implement Azure Sentinel, you first onboard it by connecting it to your security sources. This is done via numerous connectors that are available right out of the box. Once you’ve connected your data sources to Azure Sentinel. You can then monitor that data using the integration with Azure monitor workbooks that Azure Sentinel offers.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel then uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents. Now incidents are groups of related alerts that when taken together can create an actionable possible-threat that you can investigate and resolve. By correlating alerts into incidents, what Azure Sentinel does is it reduces the amount of noise that you have to sift through in order to review and investigate real alerts.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel is built on the foundation of Azure logic apps. Because of this Azure Sentinel offers automation and orchestration features that allow you to automate common tasks and to simplify security orchestration with playbooks, which you can build with Azure logic apps. There are over 200 connectors that you can use to integrate with various services. For example, there are connectors that allow you to integrate with ServiceNow, Zendesk, slack, cloud app security, and many other applications.</p>
<p>For example, if you use Zendesk as your ticketing system, you can use the tools that Azure logic apps offers to automate workflows and to automatically open tickets in Zendesk any time a specific event is detected.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel also offers deep investigation tools that allow you to better understand the scope and root cause of specific security threats. Its hunting tools, or search and query tools, allow you to proactively hunt for security threats across all of your organization’s data sources before an actual alert even gets triggered. This hunting capability allows you to get ahead of many security threats.</p>
<p>There is even an Azure Sentinel community that you can leverage. You can use the community to improve your threat detection and automation. This is made possible because Microsoft security analysts regularly create new workbooks, playbooks, and hunting queries and they post them to the community. You can then use these resources in your own environment.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, Azure Sentinel in a nutshell, it allows you to collect security data, it allows you to detect threats using threat intelligence, it allows you to investigate critical incidents using artificial intelligence, and it allows you to respond to such threats.</p>
<h1 id="Onboarding-Azure-Sentinel"><a href="#Onboarding-Azure-Sentinel" class="headerlink" title="Onboarding Azure Sentinel"></a>Onboarding Azure Sentinel</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Onboarding Azure Sentinel. In this lesson, we’ll take a look at some of the requirements for Azure Sentinel and at some of the pre-requisites for onboarding it.</p>
<p>So, before you begin using Azure Sentinel with Microsoft 365, you first need to onboard it. Once you’ve onboarded it, you then need to connect your data sources. Now, in the context of this course, we are going to discuss Azure Sentinel as it relates to Microsoft 365. And that being the case, I want to point out that Azure Sentinel comes with several connectors for Microsoft 365 offerings. It includes a connector for Microsoft 365 defender, Microsoft 365 sources, which includes office 365, and it includes a connector for Microsoft defender for identity, which was formerly Azure ATP. Azure Sentinel also includes connectors for Microsoft cloud app security, Azure ad, and several other features and offerings.</p>
<p>Once you connect your data sources to Azure Sentinel, you can then use workbooks from a gallery to gather insights into your organization, based on the data that is collected.</p>
<p>Before you onboard Azure Sentinel, you need to meet some global prerequisites.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you need to have an active Azure subscription. That kind of goes without saying. However, you also need a log analytics workspace to use Azure Sentinel. Now, once you meet these global prerequisites, in order to enable and use Azure Sentinel, you’ll need specific permissions. To enable Azure Sentinel, contributor permissions are needed to the subscription that contains the Azure Sentinel workspace. Using Azure Sentinel requires you to have either contributor or reader permissions on the resource group that contains the Azure Sentinel workspace. And depending on the specific data sources you want to connect to; you may need other permissions to those data sources as well.</p>
<p>Enabling Azure Sentinel is actually pretty straightforward. All you have to do is sign into the portal and then search for Azure Sentinel. From there, you simply click add and then create a workspace. After creating a workspace, you can add Azure Sentinel. In the upcoming demonstration, I will walk you through this process.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Onboard-Azure-Sentinel"><a href="#DEMO-Onboard-Azure-Sentinel" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Onboard Azure Sentinel"></a>DEMO: Onboard Azure Sentinel</h1><p>Hello, and welcome back. What we’re gonna do here in this brief demonstration is just walk through the process of enabling Azure Sentinel in Microsoft Azure. On the screen here, I’m logged into my Azure portal. I’m at the homepage and I’m logged in as an admin for my fictional Berks Batteries organization.</p>
<p>To enable Azure Sentinel, what I can do here is search up the top here in the search bar for Azure Sentinel. And what we’ll do here is we’ll select it from services and we can see, we have no Azure Sentinel to display here. So let’s go ahead and create Azure Sentinel. And then what we have to do here is create a workspace for Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>Now, if we had an existing workspace available, we could select it, but we don’t have any. So we’ll go ahead and create a new workspace here. Now to create our workspace, we need to provide some basic information. Essentially, what we’re creating is a log analytics workspace. So what we’ll do here is we’ll deploy into our Berks Batteries subscription. And then what we’ll do is deploy into the Berks RG resource group. We could create a new one if we wanted to. But this one works for this demonstration.</p>
<p>Now, if we hover over the icon here for name, we can see that the workspace name needs to be between four and 63 characters. It can be letters, digits, or the hyphen. So what we’ll do here is we’ll just call this MyWorkspace. Now, if we next over to pricing here, we can choose a pricing tier. Now the only pricing tier I have available to me is pay as you go. So that’s what we’ll go with here.</p>
<p>We’ll go ahead and click through to tags. We’re not gonna do any tagging here, so we’ll review and create. And then from here, we can review our settings and then go ahead and deploy the log analytics workspace. So we’ll close our notification here. And so now we have a workspace here, and we’ll go ahead and add. And what we’re doing here is adding Azure Sentinel to the new workspace.</p>
<p>And now we can see we’ve successfully deployed Azure Sentinel. And from this getting started page here, we can connect to data sources to collect data. We can create security alerts, and we can perform automation and orchestration. Under threat management, we can look at incidents. We can look at workbooks. We can perform hunting. And then of course, under configuration, we can configure data connectors, analytics, and configure the watch list.</p>
<h1 id="Connecting-Azure-Sentinel-to-Microsoft-365"><a href="#Connecting-Azure-Sentinel-to-Microsoft-365" class="headerlink" title="Connecting Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365"></a>Connecting Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365</h1><p>Welcome to connecting Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365. In this lesson, will take a look at the different Microsoft 365 services that Azure Sentinel can be connected to.</p>
<p>Now, before we get into the specifics of each of the Microsoft 365 services, let’s just take a quick look at the generic overview process of how Azure Sentinel connects to data sources.</p>
<p>We’ve already established that Azure Sentinel pulls data in from different services and apps by connecting to them and then forwarding events and logs into Azure Sentinel. To connect to the different data sources in your environment, including Microsoft 365 data sources, you use the data connectors page in Azure Sentinel. From the data connectors page, you can open the data connectors, gallery, which is a list of all of the different data sources that you can connect to. From here, you can select the data source you are most interested in. Once you connect Azure Sentinel to your data source, you can then stream logs from that data source into Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel comes with a Microsoft 365 defender connector. This allows you to connect Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365 defender, which was actually formerly known as Microsoft threat protection. This connector includes incident integration and allows you to stream all Microsoft 365 defender incidents and alerts into Azure Sentinel. It also ensures that the incidents between both portals, meaning the Microsoft 365 defender portal and Azure Sentinel are synchronized.</p>
<p>The Microsoft 365 defender connector also allows you to stream advanced hunting events from Microsoft defender for endpoint into Azure Sentinel as well.</p>
<p>Visit the URL on your screen to read more about integration with Microsoft 365 defender:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-microsoft-365-defender">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-microsoft-365-defender</a></p>
<p>Another Microsoft 365 service that you can connect to from Azure Sentinel is Microsoft defender for endpoint. Azure Sentinel’s Microsoft defender for endpoint connector can be used to stream alerts from Microsoft defender for endpoint into Azure Sentinel. This allows you to analyze security events across the organization, and it also allows you to build playbooks to facilitate a more effective and immediate response to threats.</p>
<p>The URL on your screen provides more information about integration with Microsoft defender for endpoint:</p>

<p>Azure Sentinel’s office 365 log connector allows you to pull in ongoing user and admin activities in exchange, SharePoint, one drive, and teams into Azure Sentinel. The information that gets pulled in includes things like file downloads, access requests sent, mailbox operations, team events, and many other important bits of office 365 information. When you connect office 365 logs to Azure Sentinel, you can view and analyze all of this data in workbooks, you can create custom alerts, and you can incorporate the data into existing investigation processes.</p>
<p>Visit the URL on your screen to read more about integrating office 365 logs and Azure Sentinel:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365</a></p>
<p>You can also connect Azure Sentinel to Microsoft defender for office 365. Microsoft defender for office 365 was formerly known as office 365 advanced threat protection. Now, I’m not going to go into details on this offering because, at the time of this course creation, the ingestion of Microsoft defender for office 365 alerts is in public preview. Since it’s in public preview, things could change.</p>
<p>To read all about integration with Microsoft defender for office 365, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365-advanced-threat-protection">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-office-365-advanced-threat-protection</a></p>
<p>Join me in the next lesson, where I’ll show you how to connect office 365 logs to Azure Sentinel.</p>
<h1 id="DEMO-Connect-Office-365-Logs-to-Azure-Sentinel"><a href="#DEMO-Connect-Office-365-Logs-to-Azure-Sentinel" class="headerlink" title="DEMO: Connect Office 365 Logs to Azure Sentinel"></a>DEMO: Connect Office 365 Logs to Azure Sentinel</h1><p>Hello, and welcome back. What we’re gonna do in this demonstration here is connect Azure Sentinel to our Office 365 logs. Now on the screen here, I’m logged in to my Azure portal. I’m at the Azure Sentinel overview page for the Sentinel that we deployed earlier. And what we’re gonna do here is connect it to Office 365.</p>
<p>Now to do that, we simply browse down to data connectors here under Configuration in the left-hand pane. And then from here, this data connectors page shows us all of the different data connectors we have at our disposal. Now, one of these data connectors, if we scroll down here, is going to be Office 365. So what we’ll do here is we’ll select Office 365 from the list. And then if we scroll down further, we have an option here to open the connector page, which is what we’ll do here.</p>
<p>Now on this instructions pane, we have really two separate pieces. We have the prerequisites pane and the configuration pane. Prerequisites here tell us what we need in terms of a workspace and in terms of tenant permissions. The green check marks here tell us we’re good. And then under Configuration here, this is where we can tell Azure Sentinel what we’re interested in. Essentially we can select what record types we want to collect from Office 365. For this demonstration here, we’ll just select Exchange logs, and then we’ll apply the changes.</p>
<p>Now we don’t have any previously connected tenants here, so we don’t have to do anything here. If we click Next steps here, we can see the recommended workbooks and query samples along with analytics rule templates that come with the Office 365 log connector. We can use these to get insight into our environment.</p>
<p>If we select Exchange Online, we’ll go ahead and select it. The green check mark here tells us we do have the required data types for this particular template. If we scroll down, we can view the template. And then from here we gonna notice that the query can’t run because we haven’t set any parameters. So we do this in activities here. So we’ll select the dropdown for activities. And we’ll select all.</p>
<p>Now, since the Berks Batteries tenant here, this subscription is just a lab environment, I haven’t been using Exchange. So I wouldn’t expect to see any activities here. And that’s what’s happening here. If we scroll down, we could also see user activities, admin activities, any kind of external access activities, access activities by activity. And these are all listed under suspicious. We can see hard delete activities.</p>
<p>So everything that happens within our Exchange environment would be shown through Azure Sentinel through this workbook. But like I said, since I’m not doing anything with Exchange in this particular lab, I really have nothing to show here. But that’s how you connect a data source to Azure Sentinel using the Azure portal.</p>
<h1 id="Visualizing-with-Azure-Sentinel"><a href="#Visualizing-with-Azure-Sentinel" class="headerlink" title="Visualizing with Azure Sentinel"></a>Visualizing with Azure Sentinel</h1><p>Welcome to Visualizing with Azure Sentinel. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use Azure Sentinel to view and monitor what’s going on in your environment. </p>
<p>Once you’ve connected your Microsoft 365 data sources to Azure Sentinel, it begins providing visualization and analysis of that data. This visualization and analysis allows you to better see what’s happening in your environment. As I mention elsewhere in this course, workbooks are used to gather insights into the environment.</p>
<p>To visualize and analyze data collected about your environment, you can start with the overview dashboard, because the overview dashboard shows the overall security posture of your organization. From the dashboard, you can click on specific information within the tiles to drill down into the raw data that you are most interested in. </p>
<p>Viewing the Azure Sentinel dashboard is as easy as browsing to the Azure portal and selecting Azure Sentinel. From Azure Sentinel, you can then choose the workspace you want to monitor.</p>
<p>The image on your screen shows what a typical workspace looks like. Notice the toolbar across the top. What this toolbar does is show you how many events were generated during the selected time period. It compares them to the previous 24 hours. The toolbar also shows you the alerts that were triggered from those events. It tells you how many are open, how many are still in progress, and how many are closed. </p>
<p>The main pane of the overview page shows the overall security status of the workspace. For example, the <strong>Events and alerts over time</strong> tile shows the number of events and how many alerts were generated as a result of those events. </p>
<p>The <strong>Potential malicious events</strong> tile shows where in the world alerts are generated due to traffic sources that are known to be malicious. The orange notations represent inbound traffic, which in turn, represents people trying to access your organization from known malicious IP addresses. Red denotes outbound activity. These entries refer to incidents where data is being streamed out of the organization to known malicious IP addresses.</p>
<p>Over on the right side, you’ll notice the <strong>Recent incidents</strong> pane. This pane allows you to view recent incidents, along with their severity and the number of alerts associated with each incident. </p>
<p>Underneath the recent incidents pane is the <strong>Data source anomalies</strong> pane. This pane shows anomalies in your data sources that are based on models created by Microsoft’s data analysts.</p>
<p>In each of these panels, you can click on the underlying data to further investigate.</p>
<h1 id="Using-Workbooks"><a href="#Using-Workbooks" class="headerlink" title="Using Workbooks"></a>Using Workbooks</h1><p>Once you’ve connected Azure Sentinel with the data sources you are interested in, you can begin visualizing and monitoring that data. This is accomplished through the use of workbooks. Using workbooks to visualize and monitor things allows you to create custom dashboards that display only what you are interested in. You can use built-in workbook templates, or you can build custom workbooks, depending on what data you are interested in.</p>
<p>Using a built-in workbook is pretty straightforward. Simply browse to Workbooks within the Sentinel portal to select Templates. Doing so displays the full list of built-in Azure Sentinel workbooks. If a workbook is relevant to any data types you’ve connected Sentinel to, the <strong>Required data types</strong> field for the selected workbook will show a green checkmark.</p>
<p>After selecting the relevant workbook, clicking <strong>View template</strong> allows you to view the template populated with your data.</p>
<p>You can then edit the workbook and then click Save. You’ll be prompted to choose a location where you want to save the JSON file for the template.</p>
<p>Once you’ve saved the new workbook, you can click View saved workbook, to view it. To edit it, click the Edit button at the top. Editing a workbook allows you to customize it for your specific needs. </p>
<p>Once you are done making your changes, you can save the workbook.</p>

<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Congratulations. You’ve come to the end of Monitoring Microsoft 365 Security with Azure Sentinel. Let’s review what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>We kicked things off with an introductory look at what Azure Sentinel is and at what it offers. You also learned how to onboard Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>We then took a look at the process required for connecting Azure Sentinel to Microsoft 365. You also got to watch over my shoulder as I connected Azure Sentinel to Office 365.</p>
<p>After covering the onboarding of Azure Sentinel and the connection of Sentinel to Microsoft 365, we looked at how you can visualize data using Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>We wrapped things up by covering workbooks.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have an understanding of how to onboard Azure Sentinel and how to connect it to Microsoft 365 and Office 365.</p>
<p>To learn more about Azure Sentinel, you can, and should, read Microsoft’s published documentation. You should also keep an eye out for new courses on Cloud Academy, because we’re always publishing new ones. </p>
<p>Be sure to give this course a rating, and if you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As always, thanks for watching, and happy learning!</p>
