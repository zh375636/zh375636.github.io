<h1 id="What-is-Shared-Responsibility"><a href="#What-is-Shared-Responsibility" class="headerlink" title="What is Shared Responsibility?"></a>What is Shared Responsibility?</h1><p>Hi there. In this lecture, we’re going to talk about the shared responsibility model. This is important to understand because, if you are an organization considering a move to the cloud, you need to understand which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security tasks</a> the cloud provider is responsible for handling and which tasks are handled by you. These responsibilities will vary depending on the workload. For example, the responsibilities for SaaS workloads will differ from IaaS workloads, which will differ from PaaS workloads, which will differ from on-prem responsibilities.</p>
<p>When you host your workloads in an on-prem datacenter, you own everything. However, as you move to the cloud, some of your security responsibilities are handed over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>The graphic on your screen details the general areas of responsibility for you and for Microsoft, based on where the workloads are hosted.</p>
<p>As you can see, whether your workloads run on-prem or in the cloud, you always own your data and identities, so you are responsible for the security of them. You are also responsible for your on-prem resources, along with any cloud components you control. Whether your workloads are hosted in the cloud or on-prem, you always retain the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/responsibilities-by-platform/">responsibility</a> for your data, your endpoints, your accounts, and access management.</p>
<h1 id="Responsibilities-by-Platform"><a href="#Responsibilities-by-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Responsibilities by Platform"></a>Responsibilities by Platform</h1><p>Let’s break things down by platform. </p>
<p>For on-premises <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">solutions</a>, the customer will always be responsible for all aspects of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/general-azure-security/">security</a> and operations. </p>
<p>For IaaS solutions, the cloud provider will be responsible for the tangible aspects – things like servers and network hardware. The hypervisor is also managed by the cloud provider – as are the physical datacenters that host the hardware. The customer will typically be responsible for securing and managing operating systems on servers, network configurations, applications that are deployed, identity management, and, of course, data. </p>
<p>Solutions built on the PaaS platform push more <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/what-is-shared-responsibility/">responsibility</a> onto the cloud provider. In addition to the same things that the cloud provider is responsible for in an IaaS deployment, the provider is additionally responsible for managing and securing the network controls. The customer, however, is still at least partially responsible for securing and managing its applications, user identities, and data. </p>
<p>SaaS solutions push even more responsibility onto the provider. This is because the cloud provider provides the application to the customer as a service. This removes the customer’s responsibility for ANY underlying components. That said, the customer is still responsible for ensuring that its data is properly classified. The provider and customer will share the responsibility for managing users and end-point devices.</p>
<p>It’s critical to understand that, while cloud providers can offer significant security and compliance advantages over an on-prem solution, these advantages do not, in any way, absolve the customer from protecting its users, applications, and service offerings. </p>
<h1 id="General-Azure-Security"><a href="#General-Azure-Security" class="headerlink" title="General Azure Security"></a>General Azure Security</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to General Azure Security. In this lesson, we’re going to look at the many <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security-related services</a> and technologies that are available in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>. We’ll take a look at Azure Security Center, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Monitor logs.</p>
<p>Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system. It’s used to improve the security of not only Azure resources, but also of your data centers. Security Center provides advanced threat protection for workloads in the cloud and for on-prem workloads by providing you with tools that you can use to harden your network and to secure your services.</p>
<p>Organizations will typically use Azure Security Center to address common security challenges, including things like workloads that are constantly changing and sophisticated security threats. </p>
<p>Quickly changing workloads, for example, present unique security challenges because it can be difficult to ensure that, despite the constant changes, these workloads remain compliant with your security standards and that they follow security best practices.</p>
<p>Regardless of where your workloads are hosted – whether in the cloud or on-prem, security threats are becoming more and more sophisticated. That being the case, you need to ensure that you are effectively securing your public cloud workloads. This is because anything in the public cloud is directly or indirectly Internet-facing. Because of this, these workloads can leave you open to attacks if you don’t follow security best practices.</p>
<p>Azure Security Center helps address these challenges by assessing your environment for you. These assessments help you better understand the status and security of your resources. Security Center will then make recommendations that you can follow to better secure those resources.</p>
<p>Azure Key Vault is a cloud solution that allows organizations to centrally store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates. </p>
<p>By leveraging Azure Key Vault, an organization can not only securely store things like tokens, passwords, and certificates, but it can also tightly control access to them.</p>
<p>Azure Key Vault can also be used as a Key Management solution because of how easy it makes it to create and control encryption keys that are used to encrypt your data.</p>
<p>You can also use Azure Key Vault to provision, manage, and deploy public and private TLS and SSL certificates that you plan to use with Azure and with internal connected resources.</p>
<p>I should also mention that you can use Key Vault to store secrets that are backed by Hardware Security Modules, or HSMs. They can be protected either by software or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.</p>
<p>Accessing an Azure Key Vault requires proper authentication and authorization. The authentication, which establishes the identity of the user or app, is performed by Azure Active Directory. Authorization, which determines the operations that the user or app is allowed to perform, is typically handled via role-based access control or via a Key Vault access policy.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that Azure Key Vault is designed in such a way that Microsoft cannot, and does not, see or extract your data.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor collects data that you can use to monitor your environment. This data fits into one of two fundamental types. They include Metrics and Logs. Since this course focuses on security, we’ll key in on the log data that Azure Monitor collects, rather than the metrics data. </p>
<p>The Logs in Azure Monitor can be used to perform complex analysis across data that’s collected from many different sources. However, it important to understand the difference between Azure Monitor Logs and different sources of log data in Azure. </p>
<p>Let’s take subscription-level events in Azure, for example. These types of events are written to an activity log, which can be viewed from the Azure Monitor menu. While most Azure resources will record detailed operational information resource logs that can be forwarded to different locations, Azure Monitor Logs is actually a log data platform. This log data platform collects resource and activity logs, along with other monitoring data that can be analyzed to provide information on all resources across your entire environment.</p>
<p>Events are one of the more common types of log entry collected by Azure Monitor. Such events are typically created by applications or services that you are running – and they usually provide information that indicates when a specific resource was created or modified, or when an error was detected in an application.</p>
<p>The table on your screen shows the different ways that you can use Azure Monitor Logs.</p>
<p>You can use Log Analytics to write log queries, and the Data Explorer analysis engine to interactively analyze the data. The Application Insights analytics console in the Azure portal can also be used to write log queries. Using Application Insights, you can interactively analyze the log data.</p>
<p>You can visualize your Azure Monitor Logs by rendering the data as tables or charts and pinning them to your Azure dashboard. You can also create workbooks that combine several sets of data into a single report. There are many other ways to visualize your data as well.</p>
<p>You can even configure log alert rules that can either send out notifications or perform automated actions whenever a query produces results that match a defined result.</p>
<p>You can access log query results using multiple tools, including the Azure CLI and PowerShell. You can even access them from a custom application using REST API.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor Logs can also be used to build workflows. To do this, you could retrieve the log data and copy it to an external location, using Logic Apps.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel is a cloud-based security information event management solution that provides intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. It’s an all-in-one solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel provides you with a 30,000-foot view of the enterprise while helping you identify and mitigate even the most sophisticated attacks. It’s intelligence helps you deal with the never-ending stream of alerts.</p>
<p>Using Azure Sentinel, you can collect data on all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure – whether they reside on-prem or in other clouds. The service can even detect threats that were previously considered undetectable while minimizing false positives through the use of Microsoft’s analytics and threat intelligence. </p>
<p>By leveraging artificial intelligence, Azure Sentinel allows you to investigate threats and to actively hunt for suspicious activities at scale. Its built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks allows you to respond quickly to incidents.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel incorporates existing Azure technologies, like Logic Apps, Log Analytics, and AI. This brings robust investigation and detection capabilities to organizations that deploy Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>To onboard Azure Sentinel, you need to first connect it to your existing data sources. Sentinel comes with numerous connectors right out of the box, including connectors for Microsoft solutions like Microsoft Threat Protection, Microsoft 365, Azure AD, and more.</p>
<p>After connecting to your data sources, you can begin monitoring your data via Azure Sentinel’s integration with Azure Monitor Workbooks. </p>
<p>Azure Sentinel offers automation and orchestration solutions that can handle new technologies and even the newest threats that emerge.</p>
<p>Azure Sentinel’s investigation tools help you determine the scope of potential security threats while helping you find the root causes of them.</p>
<p>The hunting search-and-query tools that Azure Sentinel provides allow you to proactively hunt for security threats across your data sources before an alert is ever triggered.</p>
<p>The Sentinel community even offers community-provided workbooks, playbooks, and hunting queries that you can use in your own environment. </p>

<h1 id="Storage-Security"><a href="#Storage-Security" class="headerlink" title="Storage Security"></a>Storage Security</h1><p>Hi there! Welcome to Storage Security! In this lecture, we’re going to take a look at a few of the different storage <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security</a> options that are available in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>. We’ll look at Azure Storage Service Encryption, Shared Access Signatures, Storage Account Keys, and Storage Analytics.</p>
<p>Data that is persisted to the cloud is automatically encrypted by Azure, through Azure Storage encryption. This process protects the data you store and helps you meet organizational security and compliance commitments.</p>
<p>Data stored in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption. </p>
<p>When a new storage account is provisioned, Azure Storage encryption is automatically enabled for it – and this encryption cannot be disabled. Since data in Azure is secured by default, organizations don’t need to bother with code modifications or application changes in order to leverage Azure Storage encryption.</p>
<p>I should also point out that all storage accounts, whether they are standard or premium tiers, are encrypted. It’s also important to note that all Azure Storage redundancy options support encryption. Azure Storage resources, including blobs, disks, files, queues, and tables are also encrypted – along with all object metadata.</p>
<p>These encryption services have no effect Azure Storage performance, nor is there any additional cost for Azure Storage encryption.</p>
<p>For more information on Azure Storage Encryption, visit the URL that you see on your screen.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption</a></p>
<p>Shared Access Signatures are another storage security feature in Azure. Shared access signatures, or SAS, provide secure delegated access to resources in a storage account - and they do so without compromising data security. Shared access signatures provide granular control over how your data can be accessed, and they allow you to control which resources can be accessed by an entity, what permissions that entity has on those resources, and how long the shared access signature is valid.</p>
<p>There are three types of shared access signatures that are supported by Azure Storage. They include user delegation SAS, service SAS, and account SAS.</p>
<p>A user delegation SAS, which applies to Blob storage only, is secured with Azure AD credentials and by the permissions specified for the SAS. </p>
<p>A service SAS is secured with the storage account key and is used to delegate access to a resource in either Blob storage, Queue storage, Table storage, or Azure Files. It delegates access to a resource in just one of the services.</p>
<p>An account SAS is also secured with the storage account key. However, unlike a service SAS, it delegates access to resources in one or more of the storage services. The same operations that are available via a service SAS or a user delegation SAS are also available via an account SAS. </p>
<p>Microsoft recommends as a best practice that you use Azure AD credentials, rather than the account key, whenever possible. They make this recommendation because the account key can be more easily compromised.</p>
<p>So, how exactly does a shared access signature work? Well, it’s actually rather simple.</p>
<p>A shared access signature, or SAS, is a signed URI that includes a special token and a set of query parameters, which includes a signature. This signed URI points to a storage resource, and the token dictates how the resource can be accessed by the client. The signature is built from the SAS parameters and then signed with the key that was originally used to create the SAS. </p>
<p>When a SAS URI is presented to Azure Storage as part of a request, Azure checks the SAS parameters and signature to determine their validity for authorizing the request. Assuming the signature is valid, the request is then authorized. If the signature is NOT valid, the request is declined with a 403 “forbidden” error code.</p>
<p>The sample service SAS URI that you see on your screen shows the resource URI and the SAS token.</p>
<p>Storage Account Keys are generated by Azure when you create a storage account. Azure generates two of them – and each is 512-bits. You use these keys to authorize access to data that resides in your storage account. This is done via Shared Key authorization.</p>
<p>Once your storage account keys are created, you should use Azure Key Vault to manage them. You should rotate and regenerate your keys on a regular basis. Azure Key Vault simplifies this process and even allows you to perform the rotation without interrupting the applications that use them. You can also manually rotate your keys if needed.</p>
<p>You need to understand that storage account access keys are essentially root passwords for your storage account. That being the case, you need to ensure they are protected at all times. You should not distribute them to users, save them anywhere in plain text, nor hard code them in apps. If you think your keys may have been compromised, rotate them immediately.</p>
<p>Azure Storage Analytics is a service that performs logging for storage accounts. It provides metrics data for storage accounts as well. This data is typically used to trace storage requests and to analyze usage trends. It can also be used to diagnose issues with storage accounts.</p>
<p>Before using Azure Storage Analytics, it needs to first be enabled for each service that you wish to monitor. This can be done manually right from the Azure portal OR programmatically through the REST API or the client library.</p>
<p>There is a 20TB limit on the amount of data Storage Analytics can store. This limit is separate and independent from the total limit for your storage account. </p>

<h1 id="Database-Security"><a href="#Database-Security" class="headerlink" title="Database Security"></a>Database Security</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Database Security. In this lecture, we’re going to review the different database security options and services that are available. We’ll look at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a> SQL Firewall Rules, Azure SQL Always Encrypted, Azure SQL Transparent Data Encryption, and Azure SQL Database Auditing.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little bit about Azure SQL firewall rules. When you create a new Azure SQL server, the SQL Database firewall will automatically block all access to the public endpoint for the server. Connection attempts that originate from the internet will have to pass through the firewall before hitting the SQL server or database. The diagram on your screen shows the flow of traffic through the firewall.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram, you can define server-level IP firewall rules and database-level IP firewall rules.</p>
<p>Server-level IP firewall rules allow clients to access the entire Azure SQL server, which includes all databases hosted on it. The master database holds these rules. I should mention that you can configure a maximum of 128 server-level IP firewall rules for an Azure SQL Server.</p>
<p>Database-level IP firewall rules are used to allow access to specific databases on a SQL Database server. You create database-level IP firewall rules each database (including the master database), rather than for the entire server. These rules are stored in the database that they are created for.</p>
<p>As is the case for server-level IP firewall rules, you can define a maximum of 128 database-level IP firewall rules for a database. </p>
<p>For more information about configuring SQL firewall rules, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure</a></p>
<p>The Always Encrypted feature is designed to protect sensitive data like credit card numbers or social security numbers, that are stored in an Azure SQL Database or even in a traditional SQL Server database.</p>
<p>With Always Encrypted, clients can encrypt sensitive data inside the client applications without revealing the encryption keys to the SQL Server, ensuring separation between the owners of the data and those who manage it. This is important because those who manage this sensitive data shouldn’t be able to see the data. </p>
<p>Always Encrypted ensures unauthorized users, including database admins, can’t access sensitive data. This means customers can confidently store sensitive data, even when it’s outside of their direct control. </p>
<p>To ensure encryption is transparent to applications, an Always Encrypted-enabled driver has to be installed on the client computer. This driver automatically encrypts and decrypts sensitive data in the client application before sending the data off to the SQL Server. In a similar fashion, the driver also transparently decrypts the data contained in query results.</p>
<p>I should mention that Always Encrypted is available in all editions of Azure SQL Database, starting with SQL Server 2016. It’s also available in all service tiers of SQL Database. </p>
<p>To learn more about Always Encrypted, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine">https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine</a></p>
<p>Transparent data encryption, or TDE, is used to protect Azure SQL Databases, Azure SQL Managed Instances, and even Azure Synapse from malicious offline activities. It provides this protection by encrypting the data at rest. TDE performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and the transaction log files at rest – and it does so without the need for any changes to the application. </p>
<p>I should point out though, that while TDE, by default, is enabled for all newly deployed Azure SQL databases, it cannot be used to encrypt the logical master database. This is because the master database contains objects that TDE needs to perform its encryption operations on the user databases.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that you’ll need to manually enable TDE for older databases of Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse. </p>
<p>To learn how Transparent Data Encryption works under the hood, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql</a></p>
<p>Auditing is a core part of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security</a> in any environment. Auditing for Azure SQL Database, along with Azure Synapse Analytics, will track database events and writes them to an audit log that you can host in an Azure storage account, a Log Analytics workspace, or in Event Hubs. </p>
<p>Auditing your SQL databases helps organizations to not only maintain regulatory compliance, but to also understand what’s going on within the database. It also helps track down information on anomalies that may or may not be related to suspected security violations or business concerns. By analyzing audit reports on a regular basis, it becomes easier to identify unusual activity and suspicious events.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that, while audit policies can be defined for a specific database, they can also be defined in a default server policy that applies to all new and existing databases on the server.</p>
<p>If you enable server blob auditing, the auditing will always apply to the databases on the server, meaning the database will always be audited, regardless of the database auditing settings. In situations where you enable both blob auditing on the database AND on the server, both audits will exist separately. You will essentially be auditing the databases twice at the same time - once by the server policy and once by the database policy.</p>
<p>That said, Microsoft recommends that you avoid simultaneously enabling both server blob auditing and database blob auditing unless you plan to use a different storage account for each, or if you plan to define a different retention period for a specific database. The only other time you might want to enable both is if you need to audit certain event types for a specific database that differ from the other databases hosted on the server. </p>
<p>Your best bet, in most cases, is to enable server-level blob auditing only. Leave database-level auditing disabled for all databases, unless there is a specific need for it.</p>
<h1 id="Dynamic-Data-Masking"><a href="#Dynamic-Data-Masking" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Data Masking"></a>Dynamic Data Masking</h1><p>Hello and welcome to Dynamic Data Masking. Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics all support a technology called dynamic data masking. What dynamic data masking does is limit the exposure of sensitive data by masking it for users who shouldn’t see it. Dynamic data masking is used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. It allows customers to decide how much sensitive data should be revealed, without any significant impact on the application layer. Dynamic data masking is a policy-based security feature that’s used to hide certain sensitive data that’s returned as a result of a query of certain database fields. Data masking hides the sensitive data without changing it in the database. An example use case for dynamic data masking would be a scenario where a front-line worker at a call center might have to identify the caller by confirming the last four digits of the caller’s social security number. In such a scenario, the call center employee doesn’t need to see the entire social security number. That being the case, a masking rule can be defined to mask all the social security numbers in the result set of any query made against the database. This allows the customer service rep to perform his or her tasks without having access to more data than is necessary. To setup a dynamic data masking policy, you use the Dynamic Data Masking blade that’s found under Security in the SQL Database configuration pane. I should mention, however, that this feature can’t be set for a SQL Managed Instance using the Portal. You have to use PowerShell or REST API. When you configure a data masking policy, you need to configure several settings. You need to specify SQL users that should be excluded from masking, you need to define the masking rules themselves, and you need to define the masking functions. When you specify SQL users excluded from masking, what you’re really doing is defining a set of SQL users or Azure AD identities that are allowed to view the full, unmasked data in SQL query results. I should also point out that users with administrator privileges are always excluded from masking, so they can always see the original data without any masking. The Masking rules that you configure are a set of rules that defines which fields should be masked, along with which masking function should be used. The fields to be masked can be defined using a database schema name, a table name, and a column name. The Masking functions I mentioned are a set of different methods that controls which data is exposed, and under what conditions. The table on your screen shows the different masking functions that are available. To read more about dynamic data masking, visit the URL that you see on your screen.</p>
<h1 id="Identity-and-Access-Management"><a href="#Identity-and-Access-Management" class="headerlink" title="Identity and Access Management"></a>Identity and Access Management</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to Identity and Access Management. In this lecture, you are going to learn about several features and services that you can use to manage identity and access in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Azure</a>. We’re going to cover role-based access control (or RBAC), Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Active Directory Domain Services, and Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. We’ll start with Role-Based Access Control.</p>
<p>Because access management is so important for organizations using the cloud, there needs to be a robust way to manage access. Role-based access control, also known as RBAC, is the tool of choice. Using RBAC, you can effectively manage which users have access to what Azure resources, what those users can do with those resources, and what areas in Azure they have access to.</p>
<p>RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager. It offers fine-grained access management of you Azure resources.</p>
<p>For example, you can allow one user or group to manage your VMs in your Azure subscription, while allowing another user or group to manage your virtual <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/networking-security/">networks</a>. Perhaps you need to assign a group of DBAs to manage your SQL <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/database-security/">databases</a> without giving them access to your VMs. You can do this with RBAC.</p>
<p>You can even allow a user or group of users to manage all resources in a specific resource group, while allowing another user or group to manage the resources in a separate resource group.</p>
<p>Segregating duties within your organization, using RBAC, allows you to grant your users only the amount of access they need to perform their jobs. By granting users least privilege to get their work done, you minimize the chances of a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security</a> incident or a mistake that could take down production.</p>
<p>The diagram on your screen depicts a Microsoft-recommend usage pattern for using RBAC.</p>
<p>Now, let’s shift to Azure AD. Azure AD is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. You use this to allow users to sign in and access resources in. You can use Azure AD to control access to both internal and external resources.</p>
<p>For example, you can use it to control access to things like Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and even to all kinds of external SaaS applications. You can also control access to internal resources, like applications that reside on your corporate network or to home-grown cloud apps.</p>
<p>Azure AD is intended for IT Admins, App Developers, and for subscribers to services such as Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and others.</p>
<p>IT Admins will typically use Azure AD to control access to applications and to app resources. They will also often use Azure AD to enforce multi-factor authentication and to automate user provisioning.</p>
<p>App developers will often use Azure AD to add single sign-on to their apps. This makes logons easier for the app users since it then allows them to authenticate with their existing credentials. </p>
<p>Subscribers to services like Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Azure are already using Azure AD – sometimes without even knowing it – because these tenants are automatically Azure AD tenants. Azure AD is how provisioning and access to these services is handled.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory business-to-business collaboration is also known as Azure AD B2B. This offering allows organizations to securely share their apps and services with guest users from other external organizations, while allowing them to retain control over their data. </p>
<p>This is a great solution for organizations that need to work with external partners. </p>
<p>Azure AD B2B provides an easy-to-use invitation and redemption process that allows external users to use their own credentials to access partner resources. </p>
<p>Azure Active Directory business to customer, or B2C, provides business-to-customer identity as a service. Leveraging Azure AD B2C allows an organization’s customers to access the organization’s applications via single sign-on that uses their existing social, enterprise, or local account identities.</p>
<p>Azure AD B2C uses standards-based authentication protocols. Supported protocols include OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML – and it integrates with most modern app and commercial software.</p>
<p>The image on your screen represents the possibilities offered by Azure AD B2C.</p>
<p>Using Azure AD B2C, you can build a single sign-on solution for your organization’s web apps, mobile apps, and even APIs. </p>
<p>Azure Active Directory Domain Services, or Azure AD DS, is a cloud offering that provides managed domain services to organizations who leverage it. It offers features like domain join, LDAP, and even Kerberos and NTLM authentication that’s fully compatible with traditional on-prem Active Directory. Azure AD Domain Services also offers group policy support.</p>
<p>The key benefit of Azure AD Domain Services is the fact that you can use them to get many of the benefits of Active Directory, without having to deploy, manage, or patch domain controllers. Because Azure AD DS integrates with your existing Azure AD tenant, you can allow your users to sign in with their existing credentials. Access to resources can be controlled through existing groups and user accounts as well.</p>
<p>Azure AD DS replicates identity information from Azure AD and can also synchronize user account info from an existing on-prem Active Directory. However, if you wish to run a cloud-only environment, you don’t even need a traditional on-prem AD.</p>
<p>If you need to run a hybrid environment with an on-prem AD and Azure AD Domain Services, you can synchronize your on-prem user accounts, group memberships, and credentials to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These synchronized objects are then available within the Azure AD DS managed domain.</p>
<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication offers organizations two-step verification. The strength of multi-factor authentication is its layered approach. And this only makes sense when you think about it. It’s far more difficult to compromise multiple authentication factors than it is to compromise a username&#x2F;password combination. </p>
<p>MFA works by requiring two or more authentication methods, including something your users know (which is usually a password), something they possess – maybe a smartphone for example, and something they are. This could include a fingerprint or some other sort of biometrics.</p>
<p>Think about, even if a bad guy gets access to a user’s password, that password really is useless without also having access to the additional authentication method that’s been configured. </p>
<p>Organizations typically use MFA to protect data and applications without making things difficult for end users.</p>
<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication comes as part of Azure Active Directory Premium or Microsoft 365 Business. These offerings include full-featured use of Azure MFA, including Conditional Access policies that can be configured to require multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Azure AD Free and standalone Office 365 licenses will also allow you to require multi-factor authentication for users and administrators.</p>
<p>A subset of Azure MFA capabilities is also available to protect global administrator accounts in all Azure and O365 subscriptions.</p>
<h1 id="Networking-Security"><a href="#Networking-Security" class="headerlink" title="Networking Security"></a>Networking Security</h1><p>Hi there. Welcome to “Networking Security”. In this lecture, you are going to learn about several key offerings designed to help you secure your networks in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/library/azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>. We’re going to cover Network Security Groups, Azure VPN Gateway, Azure ExpressRoute, and Azure Firewall. We’ll also look at Web Application Firewall, Azure DDoS Protection, and Virtual Network Service Endpoints.</p>
<p>Network Security Groups are used to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources that are connected to an Azure virtual network. When you create a network security group, several default security rules are created. These rules, in turn, allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, many kinds of Azure resources. In addition to the default rules that are created, you can create as many custom rules as you need to control traffic and secure your resources. While you can’t delete the default rules, you can create rules that override them.</p>
<p>To learn about which Azure resources can have network security groups associated to them, visit the URL that you see on your screen.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services</a></p>
<p>An VPN gateway is a virtual network gateway that Azure uses to send and receive encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-prem network. This traffic is sent over the public Internet. VPN gateways can also be used to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. </p>
<p>I should mention that, although a virtual network can have only one VPN gateway, you can create multiple connections to a single VPN gateway. When you do this, all of the VPN tunnels that are created will share the available gateway bandwidth.</p>
<p>When a virtual network gateway is deployed, Azure provisions two or more specialized VMs under the covers. These specialized VMs, which are not accessible, are deployed to a special subnet that you create. This special subnet is called the gateway subnet. The specialized VMs that get deployed contain routing tables and they run specific gateway services. </p>
<p>You can deploy VPN gateways in Azure Availability Zones so they can benefit from the resiliency, scalability, and higher availability that Availability Zones provide. </p>
<p>Once you’ve deployed a VPN gateway, you can create an IPsec&#x2F;IKE VPN connection between the VPN gateway and another endpoint, which could be another VPN gateway (to form a VNet-to-VNet connection), or an on-prem VPN device (to create a Site-to-Site connection). You could also create a Point-to-Site VPN connection that allows you or your users to connect to the virtual network from a remote location.</p>
<p>To learn more about VPN gateways in Azure, visit the URL you see on your screen.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways</a></p>
<p>Another, more secure and robust, way to connect you on-prem network to Azure is to use ExpressRoute. Using ExpressRoute lets you connect your on-prem network to the Microsoft cloud via a private connection rather than the public internet. This private connection is facilitated by a connectivity provider. You can use ExpressRoute to establish connectivity to Microsoft cloud services, like Microsoft Azure and Office 365.</p>
<p>The diagram on your screen shows what a typical ExpressRoute configuration looks like.</p>
<p>ExpressRoute offers several benefits, including layer 3 connectivity between your on-prem network and the Microsoft Cloud. This connectivity can be from an any-to-any network, a point-to-point Ethernet connection, or through a virtual cross-connection via an Ethernet exchange.</p>
<p>ExpressRoute also provides connectivity to Microsoft’s cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region. Leveraging the ExpressRoute premium add-on, you can get global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions.</p>
<p>Other benefits of ExpressRoute include dynamic BGP routing between your network and Microsoft and built-in redundancy.</p>
<p>Visit the URL on your screen to read more about ExpressRoute.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs</a></p>
<p>Web Application Firewall (or WAF) is included with the Application Gateway service and with the Front Door service. Because web applications are targeted more and more frequently with malicious attacks, WAF is used to provide centralized protection of those web applications. </p>
<p>While such attacks CAN be prevented within the application code, this strategy can be difficult to implement and maintain. That being the case, leveraging a centralized web application firewall can help simplify security management, because such a solution can more quickly react to security threats by centrally patching whatever known vulnerability exists, instead of securing each individual web application.</p>
<p>To learn more about Web Application Firewall, visit the URL that you see on your screen.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/web-application-firewall/overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/web-application-firewall/overview</a></p>
<p>Azure Firewall is another cloud-based network <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudacademy.com/course/microsoft-azure-security-solutions-975/introduction/">security service</a> available in Azure. This managed service is used to protect Azure Virtual Network resources. This fully stateful firewall as a service comes with built-in high availability and also offers unrestricted cloud scalability.</p>
<p>Azure Firewall allows you to centrally create, enforce, and log application policies as well as network connectivity policies across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks. Because it uses a static public IP address to represent all of your underlying virtual network resources, Azure Firewall allows outside firewalls to easily identify traffic that comes from your virtual network. </p>
<p>The tight integration of Azure Firewall with Azure Monitor allows for robust logging and analytics as well.</p>
<p>A distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack, can wreak havoc on an internet-facing application. It’s a real concern for organizations who are considering moving their workloads to the cloud because DDoS attacks can be leveled at any internet-facing endpoint.</p>
<p>To help mitigate these threats, you can leverage Azure DDoS Protection. By combining this service with solid application design, you can protect yourself from dangerous DDoS attacks</p>
<p>Azure DDoS protection comes in two tiers: Basic and Standard.</p>
<p>The Basic Azure DDoS tier is automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform. It provides always-on traffic monitoring as well as real-time mitigation of many common network-level attacks. </p>
<p>The Standard tier comes with more bells and whistles. It offers additional mitigation capabilities over and above what the Basic tier provides. </p>
<p>Enabling DDoS Protection Standard is easy and doing so requires no changes to your applications. The protection policies offered in the standard tier are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and even leverage machine learning algorithms. </p>
<p>To use Azure DDoS Protection, you apply protection policies to the public IP addresses that are associated with resources deployed in virtual networks. These resources include things like Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, and even Azure Service Fabric instances.</p>
<p>Azure DDoS Protection Standard can mitigate volumetric attacks, protocol attacks, and application-layer attacks.</p>
<p>To learn more about Azure DDoS Protection and detailed information on the attacks that it can mitigate, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview</a></p>
<p>The last topic I want to cover here is Virtual Network Service Endpoints. Service endpoints are used to extend the private address space of an Azure virtual network. They are also used to extend the identity of a virtual network to Azure services over a direct connection. </p>
<p>By leveraging service endpoints, you can lock down your Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic originating from your virtual network and headed toward your Azure service never leaves the Microsoft Azure backbone network.</p>
<p>Service endpoints provide improved security for Azure resources as well as optimal routing of Azure service traffic from your virtual network because they allow you to route service traffic directly from your virtual network to your service on the Microsoft Azure backbone network. Because the traffic remains on the Azure backbone network, you can audit and monitor your outbound Internet traffic from your virtual networks, through forced-tunneling - without impacting service traffic. </p>
<p>To learn more about Virtual Network Service Endpoints, visit the URL that you see on your screen:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview">https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview</a></p>
